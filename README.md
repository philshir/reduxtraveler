## General info
Live website launched November 2020 to highlight my web design and web development skills including **responsive design** that works on mulitple screen sizes and resoutions, current **UI/UX** best practices, **content architecture**, proficient use of **CSS Flexbox and Grid**, **accessibility** best practices, **SEO optimization**, site design mockup, graphics, interactive maps and responsive images and optimization using **SVG**, **Adobe Illustrator**, and **Adobe Photoshop**. Also as an frequent traveler and active member of multiple nationwide hiking groups most modern travel and hiking websites and apps only provide limited information travelers and hikers need to plan trips and we often have to visit multiple websites and apps to get the necessary details. This site pulls all this information together using feedback from multiple Facebook groups and Meetup groups.
