        <h3 class="navy">How to Get There</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            From Los Angeles (107mi) Get on US-101 S. Follow I-10 E to CA-111 in Whitewater. Take exit 111 from I-10 E. Continue on CA-111. Drive to E Alejo Rd in Palm Springs.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The City</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Palm Springs has an ideal, tourist-friendly location on the edge of the great deserts of Southern California, flanked by high forested mountains that provide an escape from the prevailing heat that persists for most of the year, and yet only two hours drive from the expanding metropolis of Los Angeles. The scenic surroundings and year-round sunshine are the main reasons why the town has grown into an exclusive retreat and retirement center. Palm Springs is just one part of a stretch of continuous development along the Coachella Valley which also includes Indio, La Quinta, Indian Wells, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage and Cathedral City.
        </p>

          <h3 class="navy"></h3>
          <p class="verd">
            A drive along the main road CA 111 passes a seemingly endless series of expensive houses, pristine shopping arcades and plush green golf courses, all interspersed by tall palm trees and other desert plants. The most traveled approach is from the west, along I-10. The pass channels and intensifies the prevailing westerly winds, and to take advantage of this the area just around the head of the Coachella Valley has been planted with hundreds of large wind generators, a rather incongruous sight amidst the sandy land. The land north of Palm Springs marks the start of the Mojave Desert.
          </p>
          <h3 class="navy">Location</h3>
          <p class="verd">
            Palm Springs lies close to the line of the San Andreas Fault, which passes along the middle of the Coachella Valley. The most traveled approach is from the west, along I-10 which passes through the San Gorgonio Pass, where the interstate crosses through the last of the arid hilly areas around Los Angeles and descends into the desert land that stretches for hundreds of miles north and east. North of the pass, the San Bernardino Mountains are a popular destination for hiking, camping and fishing (and skiing during winter); this range is a easterly extension of the San Gabriel Mountains and reaches heights of 10,000 feet. The pass channels and intensifies the prevailing westerly winds, and to take advantage of this the area just around the head of the Coachella Valley has been planted with hundreds of large wind generators, a rather incongruous sight amidst the sandy land.
          </p>

          <h3 class="navy">Mountains</h3>
          <p class="verd">
            The land north of Palm Springs marks the start of the Mojave Desert - a vast sandy plain with only occasional habitation, although the immediate north east is more hilly, and here the Little San Bernardino Mountains rise to 5,000 feet and are covered with the many curious plants of Joshua Tree National Park. The San Jacinto range is the highest in California south of the Sierra Nevada; they border the Coachella Valley to the south and support a wide range of climate zones. Snow often persists on the 11,000 foot peaks until June, when the temperature 10 miles away on the valley floor may be well over 100°F. The best (and quickest) way to experience the mountains is via the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, reached by a road that climbs up Chino Canyon, just north of town - the last section is quite steep and can be somewhat of a struggle for some vehicles in the summer heat. On the lower slopes, right next to downtown Palm Springs are the Indian Canyons, the main hiking location close to town.
          </p>
          <h3 class="navy">Palm Springs Aerial Tramway</h3>
          <p class="verd">
            The cable car ($36/$23.50 for adults/children in 2020)<br>
The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway—the world’s largest rotating tram car—travels over two-and-one-half miles along the breathtaking cliffs of Chino Canyon, transporting riders to the pristine wilderness of the Mt. San Jacinto State Park. During your approximately ten-minute journey, tram cars rotate slowly, offering picturesque and spectacular vistas of the valley floor below. Once you reach the Mountain Station—elevation 8,516 feet—enjoy two restaurants, observation decks, natural history museum, two documentary theaters, gift shop and over 50 miles of hiking trails.
          </p>
          <h3 class="navy">San Jacinto Mountain Trails from Tramway</h3>
          <p class="verd">
            All trails are accessed by exiting the Mountain Station and descending a concrete pathway to Long Valley. There you will find picnic tables, the ranger station, flush toilets and several easy trails.
          </p>
          <h4 class="navy">Long Valley Discovery Trail</h4>
          <p class="verd">
            Follow the nature trail posts around a ¾ mile (1.2 km) loop. This easy level trail provides an excellent introduction to the Park’s plants and animals.
          </p>
          <h4 class="navy">Desert View Traily</h4>
          <p class="verd">
            A 1.5 mile (2 km) loop trail leads to a number of scenic overlooks and forest views. Short climbs, moderately strenuous.
          </p>
          <h4 class="navy">Round Valley</h4>
          <p class="verd">
            A 2.5 mile trail leads to picturesque Round Valley. Fairly level trails, short climbs, moderately strenuous.
          </p>
          <h4 class="navy">Wellmans Divide</h4>
          <p class="verd">
            From Round Valley to Wellmans Divide is a 1-mile hike with a 600 foot elevation gain. The view from here is truly spectacular. Looking west you can see the dome of the Palomar Observatory and to the southwest Tahquitz Peak Lookout. From this point you can continue down to Idyllwild or up to the Mt. San Jacinto Peak.
          </p>
          <h4 class="navy">San Jacinto Peak Trail</h4>
          <p class="verd">
            This is a 5.5 mile hike one way and will take you to the second highest point in southern California. On clear days it is reported that you can see Catalina Island or the glow from Las Vegas at night.
          </p>

          <h3 class="navy">Additional Tramway Info</h3>
          <p class="verd">
            The State Park will charge $5 per person for camping permits. There is no fee for day hiking permits at this time.<br>
            <br>
What’s at the top?<br>
<br>
There are two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, observation decks, a small natural history museum, two theaters showing State Park and tram construction videos, a gift shop, Magic Memories for photo viewing.<br>
<br>
The weather at the Mountain Station is typically 30-40 degrees cooler than on the desert floor.<br>
<br>
During the past few years of drought, snow patterns have changed dramatically. In the 2019-2020 season, the first light snowfall occurred in mid-November and the final, in mid-April.<br>
<br>
 To reach the summit, you'll take the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. Once you rise 8,516 feet to the top, you can hike, snowshoe or cross-country ski before heading back down the mountain via a return tram.<br>
 <br>
Parking by the ticket office is also available for $5 per vehicle.
