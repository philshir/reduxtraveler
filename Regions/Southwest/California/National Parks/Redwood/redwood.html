        <p class="verd">
          Redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth and although once found over two million acres of northwest California they have been reduced by extensive logging during the last 150 years to various isolated patches all along the northern half of the coast, starting around the Monterey Peninsula south of San Francisco (the Big Basin Redwoods) and extending north into Oregon.
          The trees grow in quite a narrow band, from the shore up to 30 miles inland, with the largest specimens usually found just a few miles from the ocean, where growing conditions are optimum - the redwood trees require moderate temperatures and high year-round water supply. The latter is provided in winter by the frequent Pacific rain systems and in summer by the dense fog that covers the coast most mornings, conditions which besides the redwoods sustain other large trees - Douglas fir, oak and western hemlock, plus a great variety of bushes and ferns, creating a very dense forest parts of which have the greatest concentration of biomass (living matter) in the world.

        <h3 class="navy">Ring Road - North</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          A number of isolated redwood groves are protected as state reserves and state parks (including Humboldt Redwoods), but the largest and most famous area is in the far northwest corner of California. In the 1920s, three separate regions became state parks (Del Norte, Jedediah Smith, Prairie Creek), then in 1968 various parts of the adjacent forest became Redwood National Park, creating a contiguous preserve stretching 50 miles from north to south. All four areas are now jointly administered by the NPS and the California Department of Parks and Recreation, and offer plenty to see apart from the forested slopes including narrow canyons, rivers, sandy beaches, coastal bluffs and wildlife viewing, elk being the most commonly observed large species.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Orientation</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          The approach to Redwood National Park from the south is along US 101 from Eureka, a road which passes several other places of interest such as Trinidad State Beach and the Humboldt Lagoons State Park, where deposition of narrow sandbanks has created three large coastal lakes, good for fishing and bird watching. The national park begins just beyond, south of the small town of Orick, although most of its land lies either side of Redwood Creek and extends inland and about 10 miles south. Next, US 101 passes the Prairie Creek Redwoods - the largest and most varied of the three state parks, this includes several miles of accessible beach and the nearby Fern Canyon, a beautiful sheer-walled ravine. Beyond, after another narrow section of the national park, the smaller Del Norte Coast Redwoods has more groves, on hills that slope down steeply to pristine but largely inaccessible shoreline, with just a few hiking trails. The northernmost region is the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, adjacent to the Smith River and 5 miles from Crescent City. Activities here are concentrated around the river, with swimming, rafting, picnicking and hiking along its banks all popular in summer, but there are also some longer trails into the redwood forests that cover the hills to the south.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Ring Road - South</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          Although Redwood National Park has the most important designation of the four redwood parks, and covers more land than the other three (Del Norte, Jedediah Smith, Prairie Creek) combined, it receives fewer visitors, is less developed and contains really large trees in only scattered locations; also, much of the land is quite inaccessible. This is partly due to its more recent creation (1968), after most of the original redwoods in the area had been cut down, leaving old growth trees only in a few hard-to-reach locations.
          The scenic, more easily accessed redwood groves closer to the coast came under state park protection much earlier, in the 1920s, leaving the more remote inland areas open for logging for another three decades. There are relatively few trails in the national park, and most people see just one location, the Lady Bird Johnson Grove, site of the park's dedication ceremony. The majority of the park is managed as a wilderness, and is accessible only by long trails that require overnight stays at primitive campsites en route.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Location</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          The main part of Redwood National Park is a single block around Orick (see map), covering hills to the north and east of town, the lower Prairie Creek valley and a 7 mile section of the coastline, but the most interesting area is the large expanse south along Redwood Creek. Access is via Bald Hills Road - paved but in places steep and winding, this climbs from sea level to a ridge over 2,000 feet above the creek, which flows through a deep valley to the west. The road eventually becomes unpaved and exits the park, continuing to Weitchpec in the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. Of the other sections of the park, the next largest is a ten mile strip of land along the coastline either side of the Klamath River estuary, north of Prairie Creek. This has a small selection of trails and the Coastal Drive, a narrow partially paved loop road through forest and close to the edge of cliffs 300 feet above the Pacific Ocean.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Bald Hills Road</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          First point of interest along the drive is Redwood Creek itself, and a short track leads to a trailhead beside the stream from where a path (Redwood Creek Trail) follows the valley for 8 miles, linking with other trails that wind through the dense forested slopes at either side. There are three primitive campsites along the way, and this is the main location for multi-day hikes, as most other trails in the national and state parks are too short. Back on the main road, the forest has no redwoods at first but they begin to appear after a mile or so and are plentiful by the time the elevation reaches 1,250 feet and the road passes the parking area for the hike to Lady Bird Johnson Grove. This is an easy one mile loop past the national park dedication site deep in the forest, placed at a ceremony in 1969 attended by the then president's wife. Four miles further and 700 feet higher, Bald Hills Road reaches Redwood Creek Overlook, a promontory giving views over a large area of the valley below, much of which is slowly recovering from timber operations prior to the national park creation. The Pacific Ocean is visible beyond, or at least it is on the relatively few occasions when not obscured by fog. Soon after is the turn off to Tall Trees Grove, reached by a twisting, unpaved road open to only 50 vehicles a day (permits may be obtained from the visitor center). This leads down towards the creek, then a short trail continues to the grove, a region which can also be reached by the Redwood Creek Trail and is home to several of the world's tallest redwoods including one specimen that was for a while the record holder. Bald Hills Road continues southwards, along a mostly treeless ridge top, becomes unpaved, reaches a highpoint of 3,100 feet near Coyote Peak, then exits the park.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Other Sites</h3>
        <p class="verd">
          Also in the main section of Redwood National Park is Lost Man Creek - a stream and cascade reached by a short paved road, the Skunk Cabbage section of the Coastal Trail - a 5 mile path through woodland to the sea front which links with Davison Road in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, the Trillium Falls Trail to a small waterfall in a section of old growth redwood forest, and Freshwater Lagoon - one of the three Humboldt Lagoons, this is separated from the ocean by a beach which is notable for the huge logs washed up by winter storms; this region must have the largest driftwood of any coast in the world. The sands are close to US 101 and so easily accessed, and one of two park visitor centers is located right on the shore. The Klamath River unit of the national park also contains part of the Coastal Trail, reached by two sections of narrow road either side of the river - Klamath Overlook to the north and the Coastal Drive to the south, both of which are unsuitable for large vehicles. The one highway-side NPS facility is at Lagoon Creek, along US 101 just north of the Trees of Mystery (a commercial enterprise with a Native American museum and a short trail to some unusual redwoods). Beside a lily-pad covered lagoon is a parking/picnic area, from where paths lead into the adjacent forest, linking with the Coastal Trail.
