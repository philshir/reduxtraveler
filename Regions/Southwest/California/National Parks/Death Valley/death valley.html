      <div class="main-article">
        <h3 class="navy">How to Get There</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            From Las Vegas (148mi) Get on I-515 N/US-93 N/US-95 N from N 6th St. Follow I-15 S and NV-160 W to Bell Vista Ave in Pahrump. Continue on Bell Vista Ave to Inyo County. Follow CA-190 W to your destination in Stovepipe Wells. Turn left.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Named features on maps of Death Valley National Park include the Funeral Mountains, Coffin Peak, Hell's Gate, Starvation Canyon and Dead Man Pass - this is clearly a place with a bad history, reflecting the troubles and misfortunes endured by the pioneers who first traversed, inhabited and mined the region during the end of the last century. But despite the foreboding reputation, visitors today will find a place of amazing beauty with many colorful rocks and canyons, miles of pristine sand dunes. The park also contains many relics from a hundred and fifty years of history, which give an insight into the harsh life of the early settlers - borax and metal ore mines, ghost towns, charcoal kilns and other ruins. Petroglyphs and ancient foot-trails provide evidence of the Shoshone Indians who lived here even earlier.

      <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Death Valley National Park - The South</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The southern section of Death Valley, the most visited area of the national park, including Artist's Palette, Badwater, Dante's View, Devil's Golf Course, Golden Canyon and Zabriskie Point. Reached by highways 190 and 178. Facilities are concentrated at Furnace Creek. Most of the well-known features in Death Valley are located in the southern section of the national park. Visitor facilities are concentrated around Furnace Creek, at the 178/190 road junction - here there are several campgrounds, various shops and hotels, a gas station, a museum and the main park visitor center. Unlike most national parks there are no manned entrance points elsewhere in the valley.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Salt Creek</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            South of the junction with CA 267, the first point of interest along CA 190 is Salt Creek, which flows intermittently from the Devil's Cornfield area into Badwater Basin
mostly across mud flats and sandy plains. The interesting part is the two miles below McLean Spring where the waters persist all year, and in spring form quite an extensive network of branched streams, marshes and pools, some several feet deep. The creek here is bordered by green bushes and reeds yet is surrounded by bluish white mud hills, completely barren - quite striking scenery. This area is reached by a short side road off CA 267, 15 miles north of Furnace Creek - a raised boardwalk loops round some of the streams and a faint path continues further along the valley, though walking away from the official trail is not encouraged.
            
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Zabriskie Point and Artist's Drive</h3>
        <p class="verd">One of the most famous sections of Death Valley is the highly colored badlands around Zabriskie Point, Golden Canyon/Gower Gulch, Twenty Mule Team Canyon and Corkscrew Canyon. Similarly unusual and varied colors are visible a little further south in the rocks and canyons along Artist's Drive, a narrow paved one-way loop on which travel is possible south to north. Often the road bends sharply and crosses steep gullies, resulting in a rather tortuous journey with a top speed of only 15 mph, but this is a very rewarding trip with much unusual scenery, and particularly outstanding is Artist's Palette, a stretch of the hillside composed of curved bands of clayish rock in vivid hues of green, white, pink and black. There are plenty of parking places, to allow for taking photographs and exploring on foot, and the drive should be passable by all but the largest of vehicles. The route is only 9 miles long but takes at least half an hour to drive. As it climbs into the hills, there are great views across the salt flats below to the west.
        </p>

            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Devil's Golf Course</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Devil's Golf Course is a large expanse of land completely without vegetation and covered in crystalline salt deposits. The surface is sharp and very uneven, with hollows and pinnacles up to a foot in size so walking is quite difficult - this is a place to look at but not much else, although early settlers ('The Forty-Niners') did manage to cross the terrain as early as 1849 during the California gold rush.

        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Badwater</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Just south of Devil's Golf Course, the shallow salt pools at Badwater mark the lowest point in North America.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The East</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The approach to the national park from Beatty, past the ghost town of Rhyolite - via Hwy 374, which crosses into California at Daylight Pass, near the narrows of Monarch Canyon
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The West</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            This is high country - steep, wooded, cool by comparison to the desert lowlands and so a good destination for hot summer days. There are two long hiking trails - 4.2 miles to Wildrose Peak and a more strenuous 7 miles to Telescope Peak, the highest summit in the Panamint range. The approach road becomes unpaved towards the upper end of Wildrose Canyon, although the surface remains good to the first of two primitive campgrounds, and deteriorates only at the very end, near the second campground, beyond which the Telescope Peak trail begins.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Charcoal Kilns</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Another point of interest is the Charcoal Kilns - a neat row of 10 stone-built, conical structures built in the 19th century for the smoking of locally-felled pinyon and juniper wood to produce charcoal for silver ore smelting. They are long disused but well-preserved, and can be reached before the rough section of the road.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The North</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Lonelier, less visited section of Death Valley, though equally scenic as the south. Higher in elevation, sloping gradually up to 3,000 feet at Scotty's Castle. Locations include Ubehebe Crater, Grapevine Springs, Titus Canyon and the Mesquite Flat sand dunes. The northern half of Death Valley National Park is much less visited than the Badwater - Furnace Creek area further south since there are fewer points of interest and not many facilities. From the main road junction near Stovepipe Wells it is 38 miles along CA 190 to Ubehebe Crater, a deep depression formed by volcanic eruptions about 2,000 years ago. The long drive (on the 'North Highway') serves to emphasise just how much land is contained within the National Park, passing a seemingly never-ending sequence of dark, twisted, rocky hills on one side and vast sandy plains on the other.
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img three" src="../../../../../resources/images/californiaOne/deathValleyOne/mesquiteFlat/20170609_181541.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Mesquite Dunes</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            One location well-worth visiting is Mesquite Flat, just north of Stovepipe Wells village - here is found the largest collection of sand dunes in the valley. The colors and contours are especially spectacular at sunrise or sunset, and when seen from along entrance road 374, which is high enough for a good overall perspective view.

                  Perhaps the most famous Death Valley viewpoint; an elevated overlook of a huge area of yellow-brown-black badlands, with the white salt flats in the main valley beyond. The landscape can be seen from short walks near the viewpoint, or a longer hike towards Golden Canyon

                  Shallow ravine through typical, multicolored Death Valley badlands, viewable along a 2.7 mile unpaved, one-way road. Off-trail hiking reveals narrow tributary canyons, old mine shafts and extensive vistas down to the main valley.

                  Colorful volcanic crater, around 2,000 years old, near several smaller craters, cinder cones and ash hills - in the far north end of Death Valley, near Scotty's Castle.

                    Perhaps the most beautiful narrows in Death Valley - a long succession of enchanting passages through light-colored rocks, often polished smooth by floodwaters. Many enclosed chambers, dryfalls and chokestones
