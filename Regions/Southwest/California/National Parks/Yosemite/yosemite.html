            Yosemite National Park covers a huge area of the western Sierra Nevada mountains in central California and has innumerable lakes, meadows, forests and granite summits with endless unspoilt Alpine scenery. At the center is Yosemite Valley, a half-mile deep depression carved by glaciers during the last ice age, which now has soaring 3,000 foot high domes and many powerful waterfalls, including three of the world's highest. The area received national park status in 1880, as a result of the efforts of the pioneering Scottish naturalist John Muir, and has grown in popularity ever since. The Merced River runs through Yosemite Valley, and is followed either side by two scenic drives, allowing easy access to many viewpoints, picnic areas and trails.
        </p>

        <h3 class="navy">The National Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            There are three groves of giant sequoia trees in Yosemite National Park, two near Crane Flat (the Merced and Tuolumne groves) but the most famous is the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees in the southwest corner, near the private village of Wawona. More than 400 huge sequoias grow over the sheltered hillsides; the largest is the Grizzly Giant, estimated to be nearly 3,000 years old.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Western Approaches</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The remote northern half of the park is served only by the Hetch Hetchy road, leading to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. This was formed in 1923 by construction of a dam to provide drinking water for the people of San Francisco. The dam caused flooding of the lower reaches of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River - said by John Muir and many others to be as magnificent as Yosemite Valley.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Ascent to Giant Forest</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Yosemite National Park is 200 miles east of San Francisco; three state roads (CA 120, CA 140 and CA 41) approach from the west and converge on the lower end of the valley. CA 120 continues east across the Sierras via the Tioga Pass, a route that is often blocked by snow until June. No roads cross the mountains south of here for 140 miles. At the western end of the valley where the mountains at either side come close together, the roads become narrow, cut precariously into the cliffsides, and pass through several tunnels - these open to reveal an astonishing vista of vertical cliffs and green woodland, fading into the hazy distance; this is Yosemite Valley, central attraction of the park.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Yosemite Valley</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Highlights:	The central attraction of Yosemite National Park - the dramatic, glacier-carved valley of the Merced River, framed by granite cliffs up to 3,000 feet tall. Many trails, viewpoints and visitor facilities. Accessed by a one-way loop drive
Two roads lead up Yosemite Valley for 20 miles and form part of an extensive one-way system; the Southside Drive eastwards and the Northside Drive westwards. They wind through flat woodland and flower-filled meadows with occasional named viewpoints, past picnic spots and short paths to and along the Merced River, always in the shadow of the 3,000 foot tall granite cliffs on either side.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Generals Highway</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Development is concentrated along the last 3 miles of the roads, which pass carparks, campgrounds, shops, hotels and many other buildings. Most accommodation needs to be booked many months in advance, but for campers at least, there are other, less crowded options in several official sites in the forests outside the valley, along the approach roads - at Wawona, Bridalveil Creek (along the Glacier Point Road), Crane Flat, Hogdon Meadow and various sites along the Tioga Road. The valley offers over a dozen trails, for hikes ranging from 20 minutes (Bridalveil Fall) to all day.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The East Valley</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            After a second crossover road to the north, the Southside Drive reaches two riverside picnic areas at Cathedral Beach and Sentinel Beach, then passes through a meadow and enters the congested east end of the valley. The main section of the road ends at Curry Village, which has lodging, several shops, restaurants, cycle rentals and other services. This is where the northside highway heads back west, though public roads do extend 0.8 miles further east, to the main camping areas (Upper Pines, Lower Pines, North Pines) and the Happy Isles Nature Center beside the Merced River, from where starts the well-traveled John Muir Trail to Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall and many places far beyond. Also near Curry Village is one of the two main parking areas in the east valley - Trailhead Parking, for hikers bound for the John Muir Trail or Tenaya Canyon (including Mirror Lake and Mirror Meadow). Roadside viewpoints hereabouts afford views of Half Dome, a peak which rivals El Capitan as a symbol of Yosemite; this huge domed granite mountain, 8,800 feet high, was cut in two by glacial activity 1 to 2 million years ago leaving a 2,200 foot cliff with the steepest vertical grade in the USA.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Northside Drive</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Northside Drive crosses Ahwahnee Meadow and enters Yosemite Village, where most of the visitor services are found, including the main day use parking area - apart from here and the trailhead parking, in the easternmost 3 miles of the valley cars may only be left elsewhere if using paid facilities - lodges, campgrounds, stables, etc. Instead, the NPS operate a fleet of free, wheelchair-accessible shuttle buses that stop at 21 places, next to all important locations. The principal buildings at Yosemite Village are the main park visitor center, a bookshop, museum, store, post office, wilderness center, the Ansel Adams Gallery and the Ahwahnee, a grand, historic hotel. One service not available anywhere in Yosemite Valley is gasoline; for this, the closest stations are at Wawona, El Portal (the most expensive), Crane Flat and Tuolumne Meadows. two trails starting a short distance east, which lead to Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. The Lower Fall is the most visited landmark in the valley - here Yosemite Creek tumbles 320 feet onto a jumble of boulders, while far above, the Upper Fall forms a spectacular white vertical cascade, visible for many miles.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The West Valley</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            In between the two Yosemite Falls trailheads sits the venerable Yosemite Lodge at the Falls, providing accommodation since 1916. This marks the last of the built up area, as beyond the Northside Drive enters mixed pine woods and grasslands for 2.5 miles back to the foot of El Capitan, and a layby that provides the main viewpoint for those gazing up at the cliff. Neighboring El Capitan Meadow usually sees many people looking through binoculars, hoping to spot climbers high above. At the edge of the mountain, Ribbon Fall is the seventh highest waterfall in the world, with a drop of 1,610 feet, though the water flows only during peak snow melt times in spring. The cliffs further west become steadily less sheer as the road passes several picnic areas and river access points, before a junction at the end of the valley - CA 120 north to Big Oak Flat & the Tioga Road, and CA 140 west to El Portal & Mariposa.
