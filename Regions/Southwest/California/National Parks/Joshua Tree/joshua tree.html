        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Joshua Tree National Park is many square miles of wild, unspoilt desert scenery. Two factors make the park special; the eerie, spiky Joshua trees which grow densely in the western half, and the extensive outcrops of huge granite boulders, up to 100 feet high, which line the mountain ranges scattered over the whole area. Other prime attractions are six oases where California fan palm trees grow in their natural surroundings, all reachable by trail. This is not a place just to drive through, instead visitors should explore for a while away from the roads - climb some rocks or walk amongst the trees and cacti. The Joshuas are especially atmospheric and spooky at dusk, when their stark, irregular outlines become quite menacing. The land lies at the transition between the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, and has vegetation and scenery representative of both. Besides the trees, rocks and oases, the park also has many hiking trails, a network of 4WD routes, several historic sites and half a dozen picturesque campgrounds.

        <h3 class="navy">The Joshua Tree</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Joshua trees occur in patches across several Southwest states, wherever conditions of temperature, drainage and rainfall are suitable. Apart from Joshua Tree National Park, the plant is quite common across all the Mojave Desert and hence occurs in parts of south Nevada, extreme southwest Utah and northwest Arizona, favoring elevations between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. The trees grow strongly, for example, along US 93 between Kingman and Wickenburg in Arizona; this road is known as the Joshua Forest Parkway and seems to have even more Joshuas than the national park, intermingled with that other distinctive symbol of the Southwest, the saguaro. North of the national park, the Mojave National Preserve also contains vast Joshua plantations.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Roads & Sites in the West of Joshua Tree National Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The western section of Joshua Tree National Park, the Mojave Desert - higher in elevation than the east, with most of the Joshua trees, plus peaks, rock formations, campgrounds, scenic drives and trailheads
The main Joshua Tree National Park visitor center is situated in the town of Twentynine Palms, a few miles north of the park, next to Oasis of Mara; from here a 50 mile through road crosses the park to another visitor center, at the Cottonwood Spring oasis, close to the south entrance near I-10. At first, this route ascends quite steeply to nearly 4,000 feet, through the Pinto Mountains.
            
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Zabriskie Point and Artist's Drive</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Each individual site has a bench and a fire-ring, and is nestled amongst large boulders, shielded from neighboring sites and surrounded by many Joshua trees and cacti. the location is peaceful and atmospheric, especially at night when guests can sit in the open to experience the stars, the ever-present outlines of the Joshua trees, the enclosing stark boulders. Because of the relatively high elevation, for most of the year the temperature is pleasantly cool at night, in contrast to the hotter conditions in the deserts below.
        </p>

            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Cacti and Joshua Trees</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The western section of the park is between 4,000 and 5,000 feet in elevation, and is part of the Mojave Desert, where sufficient rain falls to support a variety of other plant life as well as Joshua trees, a species that needs more water than many other desert plants. Particularly common are the cholla (Opuntia Bigelovii, or 'Teddy Bear Cactus'), around 2,000 feet elevation - cholla are common across the hotter parts of the Southwest and are notable for their ferocious spines, which are sharp, grow very densely and are easily detached, since they are covered with tiny reverse barbs that cause them to pierce and penetrate the skin of any approaching animal at the slightest touch. At the Cholla Cactus Garden, a short nature trail with a series of informative plaques winds through a particularly dense region.

            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Rocks</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            More points of interest, and the densest forests of Joshua trees, are found along Park Boulevard Road that links the main entrance road with the west entrance near Yucca Valley. A spur leads to Keys View, an overlook from which on a clear day Palm Springs, the Coachella Valley and the Salton Sea can be seen, 5,000 feet below. An easy half mile path ascends the hillside at the north to the highest peak in the park - a rocky summit at 5,558 feet with even better views of the surrounding mountains. There are several especially large groups of the distinctive monzonite granite boulders close to the Park Boulevard Road, such as Hidden Valley and Jumbo Rocks, both of which have good campgrounds nearby. The rocks are fun to climb and offer many short but challenging routes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Roads & Sites in the East of Joshua Tree National Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The eastern section of Joshua Tree National Park, the Sonoran Desert - lower in elevation than the west, mostly wide basins and plains with scattered mountain ranges. Few Joshua trees but many other desert plants. Trails lead to summits, old mines and palm oases
The eastern, lower elevation section of Joshua Tree National Park is generally emptier than the west, with few or no Joshua trees; the scattered vegetation is mostly cacti and small bushes, since the land is part of the Sonoran Desert rather than the Mojave Desert. Trails lead to summits, old mines and palm oases. Pinto Basin Road crosses from north to south, exiting the park near Interstate 10 (exit 168), but most of the eastern section of the preserve is essentially roadless, and rarely visited.
        </p>

        <h3 class="navy">Cholla Cactus Garden</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Half way along the main road across Joshua Tree National Park, the Cholla Cactus Garden (elevation 2,160 feet) marks the approximate boundary with the Sonoran Desert, which is hotter and has less rainfall than the Mojave. Although teddy bear cholla are widespread across desert regions of Arizona and California, this location has a particularly dense collection where the plants grow very close together, almost to the exclusion of all other species - only the occasional creosote bush or echinocereus are also seen. A quarter mile loop trail winds through the cholla, whose long spines show a range of colors from cream-white on the newest growth to brown and black on old or dead specimens. Many fallen pads litter the ground, creating a potential hazard when walking, as they will attach themselves to skin or clothing at the slightest contact.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Cottonwood Spring</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Close to the south entrance, the one main location of interest in the Sonoran Desert section of the park is at Cottonwood Spring, site of one of Joshua Tree's six fan palm oases, near which is a campground, ranger station, visitor center, picnic area, nature trail, an old gold mine on Mastodon Peak, and the start of a 4 mile path to the Lost Palms Oasis. The final few miles of the Pinto Basin Road descend through the narrow Cottonwood Canyon between the Eagle & Cottonwood mountain ranges, ending at exit 168 of I-10.

                  At the end of the paved Keys View Road, a path climbs to the top of a small peak just to the south for a 360 degree panorama over the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and many places to the south. A longer path (half a mile) heads north from the parking area up to an even better viewpoint, on the top of a summit at 5,558 feet.

                  0.6 mile loop, 16 feet<br/>
                  At the main Oasis Visitor Center in Twentynine Palms, a paved path reaches the most accessible of Joshua Tree's six California fan palm oases, though also the least natural, as the surroundings are relatively well developed.
