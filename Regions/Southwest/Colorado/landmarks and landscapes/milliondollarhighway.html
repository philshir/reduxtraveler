        <h3 class="navy">How to Get There</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            From Grand Juction to Ouray (96mi) Follow I-70BL E and 29 Rd to US-50 E in Orchard Mesa. Use any lane to turn left onto US-50 E. Continue on G50 Rd. Take G Rd to US-50 E/S Main St in Delta. Follow US-50 E to US-550 S in Ouray.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The San Juan Range</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The San Juan range forms the southern part of Colorado's Rocky Mountains and is thought by some to have the best, most varied scenery of all. Spanning the continental divide, it has numerous jagged volcanic summits, 13 of which rise to over 14,000 feet, many lakes, waterfalls and streams including the source of the Rio Grande, several historic towns and countless relics from the gold and silver mining era of the nineteenth century, this latter reflecting the extensive mineralization of the range, as evident from the vivid colors of many of the rocks.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Overview</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Almost all of the land is publicly owned, within parts of the Uncompahgre, Gunnison, Rio Grande and San Juan national forests. The western third is the most accessible, and many of the well known sites are found close to a loop drive (The San Juan Skyway) along roads CO 145 and US 550, over 200 miles of dramatic, winding roads that pass the old mining centers of Silverton, Ouray and Telluride. Silverton is the northern terminus of the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railway, one of only two remaining stretches of a once extensive system that criss-crossed the southern Rockies. The railway follows the deep, forested Animas Gorge for 45 miles through several tunnels, over high wooden bridges and across the face of steep slopes, and is a very popular attraction, usually open from May to October. Most of the central San Juan Mountains are reachable only on foot or jeep trails - an area 40 miles square with no paved roads that includes about 80 miles of the continental divide, and is thought by some to be the last refuge of grizzly bears in Colorado. Officially though, the last one was killed here in 1979, near the upper Navajo River. There is one other road across the eastern mountains, where the summits are a little lower: CO 149 through the small villages of Creede and Lake City. These are also former mining towns and both make a good base from which to explore the surrounding wilderness.

            <figcaption class="cap"></figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Activities</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Visitor facilities are concentrated in the towns of Telluride, Ouray, Silverton and Durango, all rather upmarket places offering an assortment of art galleries, fine restaurants, souvenir shops and stores selling Western-themed clothing.
            Telluride is the location of the main winter ski resort in the mountains, known as Mountain Village, on the south side of the San Miguel River valley; there are also two smaller ski centers, near Durango and Silverton. The mountains are crossed by many 4WD tracks, most remnants from the mining operations, and off road driving is a popular activity, visiting old silver/gold mines and other abandoned sites. Numerous trails also climb into the hills, and in the western half of the range there are many places where the rocky terrain above the treeline is within reach of a day hike, such as Ingram Basin east of Telluride, Mill Creek Basin north of Telluride, Porphyry Basin near Red Mountain Pass and Ice Lake Basin near Silverton. Compared to other places in the Colorado Rockies further north, almost all areas are relatively quiet, even though the scenery is every bit as spectacular, and the trails are well maintained. The USFS operate several campgrounds along the main travel routes, and although free primitive camping is permitted in the surrounding national forest land, the steep terrain means that suitable roadside locations are somewhat limited.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">San Juan Skyway</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Various roads running through the western San Juan Mountains allow for a scenic loop drive of about 245 miles, visiting all major towns and passing imposing mountain scenery all the way: CO 145 north from Cortez to Telluride, CO 62 east to Ridgway then US 550 south through Ouray, Silverton and Durango, with the loop completed by US 60 back to Cortez, past the entrance to Mesa Verde National Park. The loop, known as the San Juan Skyway, can be driven in half a day
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Telluride</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Telluride is one of Colorado's major ski centers, receiving 300 inches of snowfall each year, and it is the snow and past glaciation that has helped to shape the land all around. The town sits amid typical high mountain scenery of steep, forested hillsides, sharp grey peaks, scree-covered slopes and smooth summits high above the treeline. Telluride is rather commercially-orientated, extremely clean, filled by expensive designer shops and with a 15 mph speed limit. The areas east of the center are a little more atmospheric and contain some old, unrestored buildings and a working mine. From here begins the hiking/jeep trail to Bridal Veil Falls and beyond.
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img three" src="../../../../resources/images/colorado-one/san-juan/san-juan-skyway-ouray-street-1000.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="cap"></figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Ouray</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            West of Telluride, CO 145 follows the San Miguel River downstream through another steep valley clad in thick forests of fir and aspen, as far as Placerville, then CO 62 heads east around the north edge of the San Juan range, through temporarily more open lands and meets US 550 just after Ridgway. This road runs south for 82 miles to Durango, through the heart of the mountains, and the next stretch has the most dramatic scenery of all. The first town is Ouray, squeezed onto a flat valley floor just half a mile across, enclosed by precipitous 2,000 foot slopes at each side. Ouray has two natural features of note, the Hot Springs, some of which are now incorporated into a municipal bathing house, and Box Canyon Falls ($3 entry), where a tributary of the Uncompahgre River flows over a 285 foot waterfall.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Silverton</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            South of Ouray the highway becomes rather precarious as it climbs sharply and winds across the face of near vertical slopes. On the right side is a long drop to the rocky canyon floor, where a stream rushes over large boulders and broken trees, residue from the spring snowmelt. The road peaks again at Red Mountain Pass, 11,018 feet, center of a mineralized area (Red Mountain Mining District) with countless old silver and gold mines - several entire mountains here are deep red because of their high metal ore content, and all around are old shafts, spoil heaps, 4WD tracks and ruined wooden buildings, a colorful and unusual scene. From here the road descends a little, past trailheads to such places as Ice Lake Basin and Porphyry Basin, to Silverton, a similar historic town to Telluride but more interesting. It is also rather commercial, catering especially to the upmarket biker community, and like all towns hereabouts has a strictly enforced 15 mph speed limit. Silverton has many well preserved buildings from the 1870s, including the railway station, terminus of the steam trains from Durango. Most of the back streets are still unpaved, flanked by authentic old houses.
