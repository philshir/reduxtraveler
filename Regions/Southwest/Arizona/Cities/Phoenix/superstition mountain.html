        <p class="verd">
            How to Get There: From Phoenix take I-10 East. After 24 miles keep right at the fork to continue on US-60 E, follow signs for Mesa - Globe/Mesa/Globe, follow signs for Mesa - Globe/Mesa/Globe. Take exit 196 for AZ-88 E/Idaho Rd. Continue driving north past Lost Dutchman State Park where Apache Trail begins.

        <h3 class="navy">The Range</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Situated 50 miles east of the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan area is one of the best hiking areas within about an hours drive of a major city. The Superstitions are the largest of the mountain ranges surrounding Phoenix, visible from many miles away along the straight roads through the suburbs east of Mesa. Formed by volcanic eruptions 30 to 15 million years ago, the Superstition Mountains are home to impressive rock walls, jagged hoodoos of rock, and narrow twisting canyons. They rise steeply above the flat desert to a high point of 5,024 feet, and are characterized by sheer-sided, jagged, volcanic peaks and ridges separated by boulder-filled canyons, all covered by saguaro at low elevations, with other cacti and bushes higher up.

        <h3 class="navy">South Mountain Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Early settlers named the hills on account of the many myths and stories told by the local Pima/Apache Indians about the mountains, and tales such as the fabled Lost Dutchman gold mine. A very popular hiking destination, though there are relatively few easy trails - most routes are quite long and strenuous, especially during the hot weather that prevails most of the year.

        <h3 class="navy">The Range</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            As one of Arizona's most rugged ranges, the Superstitions offer tons of hiking from from Class 2 all the way up to technical rock climbing. Weaver's Needle is a prominent volcanic plug monolith and perhaps the best landmark for navigation. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Lost Dutchman State Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            This popular area provides access to Flatiron, Siphon Draw Trail, Treasure Loop Trail, and The Hand.  Lost Dutchman State Park is the jumping off point for these areas. The Park is close to the wilderness area and charges a fee for entrance and parking. Restrooms, campgrounds, improved trails, and lots of people are the result of these fees.
Lost Dutchman is named after a legendary gold mine, supposedly started by a local family in 1840, and then developed by a Dutch immigrant (Jacob Waltz), who left no records of its location. Many people have tried but failed to find the mine and nearby caches of gold, all of which are believed to be somewhere around Weaver's Needle, in the Superstition Mountains a few miles east of the state park.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Range</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Located on the south side of the range, this popular area provides access to Superstition Peak, Weaver's Needle, Miner's Trail, Miner's Needle, Peralta Canyon Trail, Cave Trail, and Bluff Spring Trail.
To get to the Peralta Canyon area, take Hwy 60 from Phoenix  heading towards Globe (east) to mile post 204. Turn left on Peralta Rd.  From here go about 7 miles until your at the pay station. If climbing Superstition Peak, you could park 0.6 miles before the fee area at the Carney Springs Trailhead.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Flatiron</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Siphon Draw trail to the Flatiron in the Superstition Mountains is a challenging hike for even the most avid hiker. If you like gentle switchbacks, this trail is not for you. There are no switchbacks on this trail; it goes straight up. You gain just under 3,000 feet of elevation, most of which is in the last 1 mile of the trail.
Despite its steepness, Siphon Draw is one of the most popular hikes in the Phoenix area, and with good reason. The view from the Flatiron toward the Valley of the Sun is absolutely awesome. You can see the entire valley from there. Climb the peak above the Flatiron and get a panorama of the Superstition Mountains and Four Peaks to the North. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Range</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The trail is well maintained and easy to find up to the "waterfall" area, an unusual slickrock bowl ('The Basin'), formed at the junction of two drainages. Above that, it's marked with white dots and arrows painted on rock surfaces. A bit of trail finding skill is required or you will get into some nasty scree and precipitous rock faces. The last bit of trail below the Flatiron requires a little hand-and-foot scrambling.
The Flatiron is not a summt, but only a feature on an unnamed summit. The summit is only about a 15 minute hike/scramble away from the Flatiron.
