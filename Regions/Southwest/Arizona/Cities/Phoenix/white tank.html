        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            White Tank Mountain Regional Park covering 46 square miles; the northern half of an isolated range 25 miles west of downtown Phoenix, close to Buckeye, Surprise and Waddell.
Besides camping and picnicking, the main activity in the regional park is hiking. There are 13 named trails, all intersecting, so many different loops are possible, ranging from half a mile (Black Rock Short Loop), to 17 miles (Goat Camp, Ford Canyon and Mule Deer).
The other three routes into the mountains are significantly longer; the 6.3 mile Goat Camp Trail follows a drainage then a ridge to a three-way junction with the other two paths - Mesquite Canyon Trail (5 miles) and the Ford Canyon Trail (7.4 miles), both of which encounter a similar mix of landscapes. The 1.6 mile Willow Canyon Trail provides an alternative connecting route and hence there are six options for a loop hike, and as good as any is the 9.6 mile circuit involving the Waddell Trail, most of the Ford Canyon Trail, the Willow Canyon Trail and the lower section of the Mesquite Trail.

        <h3 class="navy">Barry Goldwater Peak</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Barry Goldwater Peak is the highest summit in the White Tank Mountains, which rise west of the Phoenix valley, forming the western boundary of the "Valley of the Sun". It is an extremely popular hiking and picnicing and mountain biking area. It is not unusual for all parking lots in the White Tank Mountains Regional Park to be filled on a pleasant winter weekend afternoon. However, few people take the time to seek out the summit of the range, with most of the hikers content to stay on the lower network of trails and seek out the famous springs, waterfalls and tinajas (natural depressions - tanks - worn into the rocky drainages that hold water well into the summer). 
The summit is a pointed peak that rises to an elevation of 4,083 feet, almost 3,000 feet over the deserts below it, and offers outstanding views. Its prominence of 2,500 feet places it at #38 on the Arizona list.  There is no route that is less than 12 miles round trip to reach the summit and back to the car.  This may explain why few people bother to attempt to reach the summit.<br><br>
As viewed from the east (Phoenix side) from below, it is not obvious which peak is the summit, with Radio Summit 4,018' (featuring a large array of communications towers) appearing to be higher. The Park, administered by Maricopa County, does not include the summit, and discourages vistors from "visiting the towers". Without a good map, the true summit is indistinguishable from its nearby ridgepoints. Only upon closer views is it obvious that the pointed peak is higher. The true summit also features a few towers, but this should not discourage hikers from seeking it out, as the hike offers rewarding desert trekking and beautiful vistas for virtually the entire way up. There is much to do within the park and hikers are advised to check out the springs, waterfalls and tanks while in the area.
The summit is not named on any maps, but it is called Barry Goldwater Peak in many sources, and even if it hasn't been officially named Barry Goldwater Peak, that is the de-facto name.  
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            There are multiple options for a hike up to Barry Goldwater Peak.  There is Mesquite Canyon, Goat Camp, or the Mesquite Canyon to Goat Camp shuttle hike.  The second and third options offers an opportunity to hike the Radio Summit (Peak 4,018’).
For Goat Camp, drive a half mile past the entrance gate and turn left. 
For Mesquite Canyon, take the road as it bends north through some foothills about a mile and turn left onto Waterfall Canyon Road. Shortly thereafter, turn left again at the first opportunity onto Ramada Way to a parking area and picnic ramadas at the Mesquite Canyon Trailhead.
From downtown Phoenix it is almost 35 miles of driving to the entrance gate. There are other possibilities to get here, depending on where you live, including the 101 Loop.
Route Information<br><br>
For Goat Camp, hike about 5 miles up to a trail junction.  At this point, go straight through a gully, which gains about 200’ in a third of a mile and then reaches a dirt road.  Take a right and continue up to Barry Goldwater Peak.  It’s about 6.5 miles to the summit gaining about 2,750’.  Alternatively, after three miles, there is a small trail heading up the face of Radio Summit.  The trail gains almost 900’ in a mile to the summit.  Once on top, head back down to the road, and continue on to Barry Goldwater Peak.  Return via the Goat Camp Trail, down the gully.  Bring good maps, but the route-finding isn’t too difficult.  Interestingly enough, going this route is about the same distance as taking Goat Camp there and back.  However, the elevation gain is about 3,500’.
For Mesquite Canyon, follow the trail for about 5 miles.  Follow signs as best you can, and avoid major turnoffs.  At this point, the trail turns south.  There is a use trail that heads up to the main road.  Bring good maps, to make sure you don’t miss this cut-off trail, because otherwise, it will add substantial distance and take you the opposite direction from the mountain.
