        <h3 class="navy">How to Get There</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            For inexperienced hikers, even a short walk along the level and partly paved Rim Trail (which parallels the south edge of the canyon for 13 miles) is enough to escape the all crowds at the major viewpoints, either by approaching either along US 180 from Flagstaff and the south or AZ 64 from Williams and the west. 
The usual place to see the canyon for the first time is either at Mather Point or Yavapai Point to the west; the latter has more parking and slightly better views. The scenic drive (Hermit Road, formerly the West Rim Drive) continues several miles further but it becomes narrow and has limited parking so entry is closed to private vehicles during the day in peak season and free shuttle buses are provided instead. Another half dozen viewpoints may be visited, including Pima Point & Hopi Point, and all are linked by a rim trail making it possible to walk between selected points before resuming the shuttle, which is rather slow and bumpy, taking about 70 minutes (excluding stops) for the round trip. The road ends at the most westerly viewpoint of Hermits Rest where several trails descend into the canyon.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Viewpoints</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The South Rim of the Grand Canyon has around 50 named points, where the rim projects outwards allowing for unobstructed views both up and down the gorge - from Rock Point on Navajo land in the east to Yumtheska Point in the west, near Havasu Canyon. Many are far from any trail and quite inaccessible, but the South Rim Drive passes close enough to 20 of them; only six require a certain amount of hiking.
South Rim Points from west to east: Piute, Jicarilla, Mescalero, Mimbreno, Yuma, Pima, Mohave, Hopi, Powell, Maricopa, Grandeur, Yavapai, Mather, Yaki, Shoshone, Grandview, Moran, Zuni, Papago, Pinal, Lipan, Navajo, Desert View, Comanche.
The best Grand Canyon south rim viewpoints are probably Yavapai & Yaki in the main area around the US 180 road junction, Pima & Hopi along Hermits Rest Road, Grandview, Moran & Desert View along the the East Rim Drive, Zuni & Papago for more peaceful views requiring a little hiking, or Yuma & Comanche for even more remote locations, reached by an all-day hike.<br>
Park at the visitor center, Mather Point, just a 100-yard walk away. The rail-grabbing view extends 10 miles across the chasm, where the forested North Rim descends in monumental ridges, steep canyons, hogbacks, and buttes to the Colorado River, one mile below. You’ll find the chiaroscuro of sunlight and clouds across the chasm more engaging than any video. Take in the view on a stroll along the Rim Trail to Yavapai Point (0.75 mile). Beyond, Bright Angel Canyon rises to meet the North Rim, a cross-canyon gorge created by the massive Bright Angel Fault. 
The majority of visitors to the South Rim first gaze over the Grand Canyon at Mather Point; although other places have slightly better views, Mather is the number one choice as it is closest to the entrance station, and a short walk from the visitor center
The viewing area is quite extensive - the point has two narrow, railed overlooks built on projecting rocks, various other view points along the rim in both directions, and to the west, the Rim Trail offers more vistas all the way to the next point (Yavapai).

        <h3 class="navy">South Rim Along Hermit Road</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The only way to explore the area west of the Village and its nine overlooks is via the Hermits Rest shuttle, walking the 7.8-mile Rim Trail that parallels the road, or pedaling a bike. Whatever the method, your first stop is Trailview Overlook, a cliffside pull-out where you can watch the mule trains leave each morning down Bright Angel Trail. the second pullout, Maricopa Point. Beyond the site, the road bends back to Powell Point, on the South Rim. For river views, however, you’ll have to continue on to Hopi Point. No need to wait for the shuttle. You can walk the 0.3 mile in 10 minutes. This promontory juts far into the canyon, providing unobstructed views east and west. It’s one of the best sunset-watching spots on the South Rim. If time’s an issue, bypass similar views at Mohave Point. Both the road and the trail here skirt the sheer 3,000-foot cliffs at The Abyss and Monument Creek Vista before arriving at Pima Point. The road ends at Hermits Rest, a medieval jumble of stone with a cairn-like chimney. Hermit Trail, a tough 10.8-mile descent to the Colorado River. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Desert View Drive From the Grand Canyon Visitor Center</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Desert View Drive edges the canyon for 23 miles east to Desert View. The only shuttle buses that operate on Desert View Drive provide access to Yaki Point and the South Kaibab trailhead, where cars are prohibited. To visit Yaki Point, board the shuttle at the visitor center. Another option is to take the 7-mile South Kaibab Trail (one shuttle stop before Yaki Point). The trail winds down the spine of Cedar Mesa to the river, but you only have to descend 1.8 miles to Ooh Aah Point for a stunning view of Upper Granite Gorge and Zoroaster Temple. Desert View Drive’s first major overlook is Grandview Point. At 7,400 feet, the towering ponderosa pines have replaced the forest of dwarf juniper and piñon pine. The steep 4.5-mile Grandview Trail drops 3,000 feet down to Horseshoe Mesa. The steepest and most hazardous section of the Colorado River, Hance Rapids can be glimpsed from the next overlook, Moran Point. For a change of pace, stop at the Tusayan Ruin and Museum, one of the park’s 4,300 archaeological-recorded sites. The short self-guided trail loops around ancestral Puebloan structures dating to A.D. 1185. At Desert View, Mary Colter’s 70-foot Watchtower rises along the Rosetta Stone of the Colorado Plateau. Inside, climb the 85 steps of this cryptic modern-day kiva to ponder paintings by Hopi painter Fred Kabotie, petroglyphs, and re-creations of Native American symbology. From the top of the tower—the South Rim’s highest point—you can see Navajo Mountain
A slightly longer, less trafficked option via US 89 from Flagstaff skirts the San Francisco Peaks to Ariz. 64 and enters the park at Desert View.

        <h3 class="navy">Grand Canyon Village </h3>
        <p class="verd">
            At Yavapai Point, explore the small museum built in 1928 as an observation station for scientists and visitors. A topographic model, a geologic column of rock layers, and daily ranger talks provide a crash course on two billion years of Earth history. The historic complex includes the original 1909 log-built train depot, the 1905 El Tovar Hotel, the Mary Colter–designed Lookout Studio and Hopi House, and the Victorian-rustic Kolb Studio. each is worth poking into for the Native American crafts, landscape photography, curio kitsch, and historical exhibits. Bright Angel Trail, a classic 9.5-mile route down to the river. Or try it yourself, at least as far as the first tunnel, 0.2 mile down.
