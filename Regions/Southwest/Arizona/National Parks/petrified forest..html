        <h3 class="navy">Petrified Logs</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Colors—both bold and subtle—abound at Petrified Forest National Park. The petrified logs themselves are a kaleidoscope of hues ranging from crimson to sapphire, mustard to charcoal, coral to pistachio—and every shade in between. The Painted Desert section of the park—a stretch of rolling badlands—is a palette of pinks, grays, rusts, ochers, whites, and browns that shifts with changes in sunlight and shadow. Although every one of America’s 50 states has deposits of petrified wood, Petrified Forest National Park has one of the greatest concentrations of petrified logs on Earth. The display is spectacular. Several easy hiking trails in the park lead to jumbled masses of downed trees that slowly, cell by cell, turned from wood to stone from 205 to 225 million years ago. Petrified wood fractures easily, so there’s a wide range of sizes to dazzle visitors—from tiny chips and shards to chunks of rock to entire logs stretching from trunk base to treetop on the desert floor. Colors glisten in the sun.

        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Of all the national parks, Petrified Forest ranks among the most susceptible to the drive-through visit. It is easy for the visitor to cruise along, stopping to gaze over the Painted Desert, and walk a short trail among the giant logs before returning to the freeway. A 28-mile paved road bisects the park from north to south. Casual visitors who come for even a couple of hours can drive the road, stop at the excellent museum and visitor center, walk into the petrified groves, and be on their way. By spending a full day, visitors can spend more time at the museum and visitor center, stop leisurely at the many informational scenic overlooks, and take their time hiking a half dozen short, mostly easy, trails. The north entrance to the park is an exit off I-40, about 25 miles east of Holbrook, Arizona; the south entrance is about 19 miles east of Holbrook on US 180. The park can be explored from either direction. Here we will start in the north; simply reverse this tour if you are starting in the south.
A 27 mile road runs through Petrified Forest National Park, from exit 311 of I-40, south to US 180. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">North Section</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            In the north, the first few miles of the road wind along the rim of a mesa overlooking the Painted Desert, past 8 viewpoints of the rolling multicolored landscape, with one short trail along the cliff edge. The patterns visible in the eroded soft sedimentary rocks are due mainly to hematite (red), limonite (yellow) and gypsum (white)
The Park Road The Painted Desert Visitor Center welcomes visitors just off I-40, before they enter the park. There is also a restaurant and a gift shop, where pieces of petrified wood can be purchased. (These specimens were collected outside the park.) The park road winds north and then turns south, offering panoramic views of the Painted Desert, a colorful swath of badlands that stretches for 150 miles from east of Petrified Forest National Park almost to the Grand Canyon. Several overlooks, including Tawa Point, Kachina Point, Chinde Point, and Pintado Point, provide sweeping vistas of the many-colored Painted Desert, including views of Pilot Peak, which, at 6,234 feet, is the highest point in the park. The 1-mile round-trip Painted Desert Rim Trail runs from Tawa Point to Kachina Point Three additional overlooks, Nizhoni Point, Whipple Point, and Lacey Point, offer more views of the Painted Desert, with slopes tinted in the earthy shades of a Navajo rug. The colors are especially vivid when the sun shines on sediment still wet from a thunderstorm. A sharp-eyed—and lucky—visitor might spot a small herd of pronghorn antelope in this area. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Newspaper Rock</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            A sandstone outcrop bearing hundreds of petroglyphs dating from around 1000-1300 AD. Farther south along the road is the spellbinding Newspaper Rock, two enormous boulders covered with more than 600 petroglyphs; viewing scopes magnify the etchings into sharp focus.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Viewpoints</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The main area of fossilized wood in the Petrified Forest National Park is along the 20 mile section of road between the railway and the southern entrance, where there are six main viewpoints and hiking areas:
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Tepees</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            After Puerco Pueblo and Newspaper Rock, the road follows a low plateau southwards, then descends into a strange, grey-white landscape of barren badlands dotted with large circular mounds - The Tepees (see 360 degree panorama). There are no official trails but it is easy to walk and climb amongst the stark formations.
Winding through The Tepees (cone-shaped formations of gray, lavender, and blue rock)
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Blue Mesa</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Reached by a short loop road, Blue Mesa features many logs lying on undulating purple-grey mounds of bentonite clay, beneath a narrow plateau. Often the logs lie partially buried in the clay, and erosion gradually but continuously exposes more of them. A one mile partly paved trail descends the west side of the mesa and loops around some of the whitish-purple badlands, past many of the largest logs. the park road comes to the turnoff to Blue Mesa, where the paved 1-mile Blue Mesa Trail drops into and loops through badlands dotted with petrified logs.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Jasper Forest</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Jasper Forest is a large expanse of logs scattered over a wide and rather desolate valley, on the west side of the road. There used to be many more logs, but this was one of the main locations for collecting by early prospectors who removed petrified wood by the cartload. There is a good viewpoint but no hiking opportunities. On the opposite side of the road, a short track leads to Agate Bridge, a long complete unbroken log lying over a stream bed. The bridge was reinforced by concrete early last century but it is of course forbidden to walk across in case the log breaks. Heading south again on the main road, visitors can see the Agate Bridge, a single long petrified log spanning a dry wash, and Jasper Forest, an eroded bluff from which hundreds of petrified logs have been eroded over time and now litter the valley floor below.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Crystal Forest</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Further south, a short trail passes through Crystal Forest. This was once strewn with especially beautiful logs, which had crevices containing clear quartz and purple amethyst crystals, but all the best specimens were removed by souvenir hunters long ago. It was this theft that prompted local citizens to petition for the creation of the then National Monument, which was established in 1906 - National Park status was not achieved until 1962. A few small crystalline specimens can still be seen, amongst other more typical logs, by the paved 0.75 loop path that has a few short steepish sections across ravines. At Crystal Forest, an easy 0.8-mile trail meanders among hundreds of petrified logs of all sizes and shapes. Here, the colors of the petrified wood can be seen up close.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Rainbow Forest</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The area with the most densely-scattered petrified wood is Rainbow Forest, near the south entrance of the national park, on the west side of the highway. Nearby is a museum which amongst other exhibits has a large collection of apologetic letters sent by visitors who have taken rock samples and later regretted their actions. Hundreds of pieces of petrified wood are returned each year. Through the museum, a 0.4 mile loop trail winds through the Giant Logs which has some of the biggest pieces of petrified wood in the park. At the southern end of the park is the Rainbow Forest Museum, with excellent dioramas and other exhibits, and fossils from the Late Triassic period. Behind the museum is the Giant Logs Trail, a 0.4-mile loop through an impressive forest of petrified logs that includes Old Faithful, the park’s most massive. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Long Logs</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            At the end of a service road (closed to vehicles), the Long Logs Trail gives perhaps the most impressive views in the park - a 1.6 mile circular path passes hundreds of large beautifully colored examples, some over 10 meters in length. A one mile spur trail leads south to an old stone hut, Agate House which was constructed entirely of petrified wood by Puebloan Indians in the 14th century. The house has been partially reconstructed and is quite an impressive sight. Across the park road bridge from the museum is the trailhead for the Long Logs and Agate House Trails, which can be combined for a round-trip of 2.6 miles. The Long Logs Trail wanders among the largest concentration of petrified logs in the park. The Agate House Trail leads to a partially reconstructed eight-room ruin inhabited beginning about 1050 B.C. It is constructed of chunks of petrified wood and mud mortar.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Backcountry Attractions</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Although there are no maintained paths in this region, off-trail hiking and back-country camping are permitted; the main destination is the Black Forest, which has large amounts of petrified wood, darker in color compared to other locations, and including many complete trunks, together with badlands and photogenic, eroded rock formations. Also in this area is Onyx Bridge, a 40-foot tree that spans a dry wash, though the log partially collapsed a few years ago. One more recently accessible destination (free permit required) is the Devils Playground, an area of badlands and hoodoos near the west edge of the park, reached from I-40 exit 303 and explorable by a 7 mile partial loop hike.

                Circular path passes hundreds of large beautifully colored examples, some over 10 meters in length. A one mile spur trail leads south to an old stone hut, which was constructed entirely of petrified wood by Puebloan Indians in the 14th century.
