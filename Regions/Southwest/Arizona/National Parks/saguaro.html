        <h3 class="navy">The Saguaro Cactus</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea Gigantea) is the state symbol of Arizona, appearing on all car license plates, and provides a universally recognized image of the Southwest. It is the largest and one of the slowest growing of all cacti, reaching up to 15 meters high and living for several centuries. Plants can weigh up to 8 tons, partly because of the large amount of water the stems can hold - after rainfall the cactus can absorb hundreds of gallons in a short time. The saguaro may be only 6 inches high after 10 years, and the characteristic branched appearance is reached only after around 80 years.
The cactus is widespread across southern Arizona, extreme southeast California and Sonora, north Mexico. Distribution is related to latitude and altitude - it is most commonly found between 1,000 & 3,000 feet, and because the saguaro can tolerate temperatures as low as 24°F, it survives further north than any of the other species of large cactus. In the spring, the saguaro produce white flowers on the upper stems of mature plants so this is an especially good time to visit.  The two park districts, 30 miles apart—one east and one west of the Tucson—offer convenient hiking opportunities. The Tucson Mountain District boasts the densest saguaro forests. The larger eastern district—the Rincon Mountain District—extends into the mountains, where woodlands of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir create a striking contrast to the desert below. Such a journey traverses five major life zones: desert, grassland, oak scrub, pine forest, and riparian.

        <h3 class="navy">Sabino Canyon</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Saguaro National Park visitor center is located along the narrower Kinney Road and also passes the short but very informative Desert Discovery Nature Trail, which descriptions of the main types of cacti and information about the local wildlife. 
Stop first at the Red Hills Visitor Center for the Desert Discovery Nature Trail offer signs that name many of the cacti and other plants in the park. The striking Red Hills of this part of the park are composed of mudstone from an ancient lake bed; the distinctive color of the landscape is the result of iron oxide. The 5-mile Scenic Bajada Loop Drive brims with saguaros. (A bajada is a foothill slope with the alluvial soil saguaros prefer.) While you’re admiring the forests of saguaro, look for woodpecker-excavated holes that are sometimes used by birds such as kestrels (small falcons) and cactus wrens. The loop drive provides access to several trailheads; consider walking the 0.5-mile Signal Hill Trail, which passes dozens of petroglyphs. Dating back some 800 years, the evocative markings were made by people of the Hohokam culture. The 4.9-mile Hugh Norris Trail is one of several ways to reach 4,687-foot Wasson Peak, the highest point in the national park’s western district. It’s a strenuous hike, one that rewards with many fine vistas and fascinating rock formations. A shorter way up Wasson Peak is the 3.5-mile King Canyon Trail, a portion of which makes a good short hike. Follow the trail 0.9 mile to the Mam-A-Gah picnic area and then return by way of the dry riverbed. 
The park can be experienced in one day—or more if you want to do some serious hiking. If you’re primarily interested in seeing saguaros, head to the Tucson Mountain District. Walk the short Desert Discovery Nature Trail and drive the 5-mile scenic Bajada Loop Drive. Consider hiking the 0.5-mile Signal Hill Trail to see Native American petroglyphs. In the Rincon Mountain District, the 8-mile Cactus Forest Scenic Loop Drive offers a wealth of fine views and saguaros, as well as possibilities for short hikes. For a strenuous hike into the Rincon Mountain foothills, do an out-and-back trek along the Tanque Verde Ridge Trail as far as time and energy allow. The trail heads uphill for some 8 miles, with little shade.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Touring the Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The one backcountry drive in the park starts along Kinney Road - Hohokam Road (formerly known as Bajada Loop), an unpaved track, part of which is one-way, that leads deep into the cactus forest and links with Golden Gate Road, a connecting route from Picture Rocks Road. The best short path hereabouts is the Valley View Overlook Trail, which ends at an impressive viewpoint of rocky hills and saguaro-covered plains
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Hugh Norris Trail</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Longest trail in the park, following a ridge of increasing height all the way to a high summit, for unsurpassed views of the surrounding mountains and desert
Fifteen miles west of the city of Tucson, the Tucson Mountain region of Saguaro National Park is smaller, lower and biologically younger than the east section but the saguaros are just as large and extensive. The north and west areas are generally flat with uninterrupted forests of the huge cacti, while the land becomes more mountainous towards the south and east.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Though it’s not part of Saguaro National Park, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum on the park’s southern border, is a must for those interested in the natural history of the region. The focus is on the flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert, with its 1,200 plant species and 230 animal species, from hummingbirds to wolves. The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum comprises 98 acres, 21 of which are outside. There’s a zoo, an aquarium, a botanical garden, and interpretive hiking trails that meander through desert habitats.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Rincon Mountain District</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            More than twice as big as the park’s western district winding 8-mile Cactus Forest Scenic Loop Drive. Take advantage of the many scenic overlooks to enjoy the rolling desert landscape and views of the Rincon Mountains. The flat, easy 0.25-mile Desert Ecology Trail reflects the ways that plants and animals have adapted to the climate. Only a bit more strenuous, the 1-mile Freeman Homestead Trail leads to the remains of an adobe house built in 1933, while interpretive signs along the way tell of early human history. There’s a maze of trails, short and long, in the northwestern part of the Rincon Mountain District, reached by turning north onto Mica View Road, off the scenic loop. For a rewarding, strenuous day hike, consider the Tanque Verde Ridge Trail, whose trailhead is close to the Javelina picnic area, along the scenic loop. It’s 9 miles to 7,049-foot Tanque Verde Peak, but you don’t have to go that far on your hike. You’ll experience fine views of Tucson to the west and Rincon Peak to the southeast as you ascend the ridge.
