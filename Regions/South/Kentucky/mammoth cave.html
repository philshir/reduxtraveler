        <p class="verd">
            One of the world’s great natural wonders, Mammoth Cave National Park sits beneath Kentucky hills and hollows. It earned its grandiose designation in the early 19th century, when tourists marveled at the enormity of its underground chambers. With more than 400 miles of mapped passageways, Mammoth Cave National Park encompasses the planet’s longest known cave system, with five levels and caves yet to be discovered. Some 12 miles of Mammoth Cave are open to the public, with tour routes offering a diversity of experiences, from strolls that focus on spectacular formations to more challenging walks that center on cave history. For the latter, visitors don protective gear and crawl through tight passageways. There’s more to the national park than just the cave, of course. Mammoth Cave’s 82 square miles encompass lush forests that teem with wildlife, as well as 27 miles of the Green River, one of North America’s most biologically diverse waterways. Biking, hiking, horseback riding, boating, and fishing are active options—before or after experiencing the world belowground.

        <p class="verd">
            Every visit should include at least one cave tour and, if you have more time, exploration above ground. Try to make advance reservations for tours, especially for summer and weekend visits. Wear sturdy shoes with nonslip soles and dress for the cave temperature, in the mid-50s F year-round. Tours are led by park rangers. You won’t really know Mammoth Cave National Park without spending some time on its aboveground trails. As is the case with the cave tours, routes range from short and easy paths to longer trails that are suitable for backpackers. Also consider a canoe or kayak trip on the Green River or a horseback ride through the park; local independent outfitters offer a variety of options for boating as well as horseback riding.

           Exploring the Cave Be sure to walk through the excellent introductory exhibit in the park visitor center, which provides an overview of cave geology, history, and exploration. Many visitors want to see the “prettiest” parts of Mammoth Cave, with decorative formations such as stalactites (hanging from the ceiling), stalagmites (rising from the cave floor), and columns (formed when stalactites and stalagmites join). The most direct route to scenic areas is the easy 0.25-mile Frozen Niagara Tour, named for a flowstone formation. This route has about a dozen steps up and down; an optional 49 steps reward with a close look at the Drapery Room. The moderately difficult 0.75-mile Domes and Dripstones Tour requires going down 300 steps, then up and down hills, to the dramatic dripstone passage of the Frozen Niagara. Certainly one of the park’s best overalll tours is the strenuous, 4.5-mile Grand Avenue tour. This route combines splendid scenery with information about Mammoth Cave’s long and intriguing history, dating to Native American exploration of the cave as long as 5,000 years ago (see here). The moderately difficult 2-mile Historic Tour provides a detailed look at the cave’s past. For a taste of what 19th-century cave tours were like, take the strenuous 3-mile Violet City Lantern Tour. Lighting is provided exclusively by old-fashioned lanterns carried by rangers as well as visitors. If you’ve ever wanted to know what it’s like to be a caver (or spelunker), sign up for the strenuous Introduction to Caving Tour, suitable for very fit visitors ten years and older. Wearing hiking boots (above ankle height) are recommended, a helmet, coveralls, and other protective gear, you’ll learn safe techniques for cave exploration so you can navigate cramped passages. (If your chest or hips measure more than 42 inches around, you won’t fit.) Similar, but even more strenuous and with a minimum age of 16, the Wild Cave Tour covers 5 miles. Needless to say, if you’re even remotely uncomfortable in tight spaces, neither of these tours is for you. Two specialized tours are well worth noting. For the Trog excursion, participants must be 8 to 12 years old. Adults are allowed to be present only as the kids suit up in coveralls, helmets, and headlamps. Then it’s off through the woods and into the cave to learn how surface and cave life interact and how to crawl through passages off the regular tour routes. The Focus on Frozen Niagara Photo Tour is designed solely for photographers. With stops at some of the most scenic parts of Mammoth Cave, this easy walk is filled with photo ops.

        <p class="verd">
            White-nose Syndrome has been confirmed in Mammoth Cave. All participants on cave tours must walk on bio-security mats immediately following the conclusion of their tour. No exceptions. Your assistance is required to slow the spread of this fungal disease affecting bats.
