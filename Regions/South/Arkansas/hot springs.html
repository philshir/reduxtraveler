        <p class="verd">
            Nestled in Arkansas' Ouachita Mountains about 55 miles southwest of Little Rock, Hot Springs serves as a beacon for outdoor enthusiasts and relaxation seekers from around the country. A network of springs inspires the town's name and attracts a majority of its visitors. In fact, these thermal waters have beckoned travelers for thousands of years, starting with American Indians. Today, visitors flock to the town's Bathhouse Row. Hot Springs' naturally heated springs are protected as part of Hot Springs National Park, but the city and the park are intertwined in such a way that visitors may feel like they're staying in the park itself.

        <h3 class="navy">Death Valley National Park - The South</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            With its intriguing mix of history, geology, and nature, Hot Springs holds a unique place among America’s national parks. The smallest of the parks, Hot Springs National Park wraps around a modern urban area set within a valley of the rugged Ouachita Mountains. The park and city, both named Hot Springs, developed side by side and remain intimately linked. Congress created Hot Springs Reservation in 1832 to protect thermal springs that had become renowned for their supposed therapeutic properties. By the time it was made an official national park in 1921, Hot Springs had grown into a popular spa, attracting vacationers as well as patients seeking a cure for all sorts of illnesses. Water that fell as rain more than 4,000 years ago flows from the Earth here at an average temperature of 143°F, having been heated at a depth of about a mile belowground before rising back to the surface. Most of the natural hot springs have been diverted into pipes flowing to hotels and to a line of spa buildings known as Bathhouse Row. The eight remaining bathhouses on the row were built between 1892 and 1923 and display a rich diversity of architectural styles. The park’s 5,550 acres encompass wooded uplands of the Ouachita Mountains, crisscrossed by 26 miles of hiking trails. Unusual for North American mountains, the Ouachitas run east–west instead of north–south.

            The park can be experienced in a day, though hikers might want to spend more time here. Tour the 1915 Fordyce Bathhouse to learn what “taking the waters” was all about. Then stroll along Bathhouse Row and the Grand Promenade to imagine the scene at the height of the bathing era. Hike or drive up Hot Springs Mountain for views of the city of Hot Springs in the valley below and national park land on surrounding mountains. Then hike one or more of the many trails.

            The center of many park activities is a one-third-mile-long stretch of Central Avenue, where Bathhouse Row lines one side of the street, facing private businesses. When the Fordyce Bathhouse opened in 1915, it was hailed as the most luxurious bathing establishment in town. It closed in 1962 but has been beautifully restored as the park visitor center. You’ll see courtyards, marble walls and staircases, fountains, a gymnasium, and the bathing area. The nearby 1912 Buckstaff Bathhouse has been in continuous operation and today offers the entire experience, from thermal water soaks to hydrotherapy sessions to massages. The 1922 Quapaw Bathhouse, closed for many years, has been renovated. It reopened in 2008 as a modern spa. The 1923 Lamar Bathhouse houses park offices and the bookstore. The 1916 Superior Bathhouse has been repurposed as a brewery using local spring water. The 1922 Ozark Bathhouse is now home to the nonprofit park “friends” group and an art gallery. The 1912 Maurice and 1892 Hale await restoration. While most spring water is piped to various bathing sites, you can see it flowing from the hillside at display springs near the Maurice Bathhouse. There are also several fountains where you can drink spring water. At the spring in front of the park headquarters, cars line up so people can fill jugs with the water—either because they believe it has curative properties or because they simply want to drink some of the highest-quality water on the planet.

            A stroll down the half-mile Grand Promenade is a must-do for all park visitors. This broad walkway runs along the hillside behind Bathhouse Row. Look for the cascade of spring water and the built-up deposits of tufa (a form of calcium carbonate or limestone) that precipitates from the water. Several hiking trails and a scenic road ascend Hot Springs Mountain, east of Bathhouse Row. There are great lookout points here, including a privately operated tower (fee) with far-reaching panoramas of the Ouachita Mountains. The park offers 26 miles of hiking trails through pine-oak-hickory woods on the highlands around the city. Several trails can be accessed from West Mountain Summit Drive. Sunset Trail, at 10 miles the longest in the park, heads west from the end of West Mountain Summit Drive. (Other road trailheads access different sections of Sunset Trail.) In a little more than 2 miles, the path reaches Music Mountain, at 1,405 feet the park’s highest point. From here, the Sunset Trail turns northeast to follow Sugarloaf Mountain; in about 2 miles there’s a spur trail to the aptly named Balanced Rock. Of the many other park hikes, one of the most popular is the 1.1-mile round-trip Goat Rock Trail. Beginning at a road overlook on North Mountain, it leads to fine views of eastern Hot Springs and Indian Mountain. Goat Rock can also be reached from the Gulpha Gorge Campground.

            In the early 20th century Trains brought thousands of vacationers to the city annually, including celebrities ranging from baseball star Babe Ruth to President Herbert Hoover. Another kind of visitor found Hot Springs an attractive retreat as well: gangsters. Al Capone was among the organized-crime figures who spent time in the spa city, playing golf, taking the waters, going to the horse races, and generally escaping the attention of big-city law enforcement. One gangster, notorious killer Owney Madden, “retired” to Hot Springs in the 1930s, where he took part in what might well have been the largest illegal gambling operation in the country. Protected by corrupt politicians, casinos flourished until they were finally shut down in 1967—two years after Madden had died and was buried in his adopted city.

What may first strike you as a standard spa, the historical property has actually been attracting travelers since it opened in 1912. The illustrious building still sports its noteworthy Romano-Gothic architecture and even riffs on its original offerings. Services include baths (in the city's thermal water) and massages, as well as manicures, pedicures and facials. Keep in mind that massages and baths are walk-ins only, while you need an appointment for other services.

            Fordyce Bathhouse serves as the visitor center for Hot Springs National Park. Now, travelers can admire the ornate architecture of the storied buildings, which are outfitted with stained-glass ceilings, ceramic fountains and intricately tiled floors.
Past travelers appreciated the opportunity to explore nearly the entirety of the building, which spans three floors and a basement. Some additional gems to discover include a grand piano and a bowling alley. Recent visitors enjoyed the Fordyce Bathhouse Visitor Center's self-guided tour, because they were able to enjoy the attraction at their own pace.

            Reaching a whopping 1,256 feet above sea level, Hot Springs Mountain Tower provides travelers with unmatched views of the surrounding area. Those who ride to the tower's top will be able to make out the Ouachita Mountains, Hot Springs Mountain and the Diamond Lakes. The panoramic view overlooks 140 miles. In addition to views, visitors can grab a keepsake or snag a snack from the Hot Springs Mountain Tower's gift shop and small cafe.
From the gift shop, you'll board a glass elevator, which will whisk you 216 feet up to the observation deck. From the deck, you'll be treated to stunning views of Hot Springs National Park.
