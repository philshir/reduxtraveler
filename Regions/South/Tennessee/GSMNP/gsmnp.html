        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Great Smoky Mountains now ranks as America’s most visited national park. It delights millions of annual visitors who come for its ancient mountains, lush forests, diverse flora and fauna, dozens of waterfalls, and engaging history.The park’s 814 square miles represent the largest federally protected upland area east of the Mississippi River. The elevation range of 875 to 6,643 feet within Great Smoky Mountains creates widely different life zones. Moving from the park’s lowest to highest points is, in effect, like traveling from the Southeast to Maine—from post oaks and wild turkeys to Fraser firs and ravens. In addition to the ongoing heritage of Cherokee Indians in and near the park, Great Smoky Mountains preserves a nationally significant collection of pioneer-era log buildings as well as structures built during the Depression. Much of the original development of facilities and restoration of early settlers’ buildings was carried out by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), an agency created to provide work and wages for young men during very challenging economic times.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            If it is beauty you seek on a one-day visit, a drive up Newfound Gap Road, a hike to Ramsey Cascades, or a trip around Cades Cave Loop Road are certain to reveal varied aspects of the park’s scenic splendor, with vast views over rolling ridges to old-growth forest to the pastoral landscapes shaped by settlers’ farms. Newfound Gap Road (US 441) bisects the park, climbing over a ridge of the Appalachians, and Cades Cove, a valley, once was home to a thriving farming community. Dense forests cloak the Appalachians. The moisture they release as a result of evaporation combined with high rainfall often creates fog—the “smoky” mist that gives this mountain range and the park their names.
        </p>

        <h3 class="navy">Death Valley National Park - The South</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Newfound Gap Road Winding for 31 miles between the gateway towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina, this beautiful drive connects the park’s two main visitor centers: Sugarlands and Oconaluftee. Along the way it passes picnic areas, trailheads, and scenic overlooks as it climbs almost 4,000 feet before descending. At the Chimneys Picnic Area (Mile 7) you’ll find the Cove Hardwood Nature Trail, one of the park’s best short walks, with old-growth forest. The 2-mile Chimney Tops trail (Mile 9) and the 2.3-mile Alum Cave (Mile 15), both strenuous, also are popular trails here. The former leads to rocky summits with great views; the latter is the shortest route to 6,593-foot Mount Le Conte, third highest peak in the park and the site of the park’s only commercial lodging (see here). At Mile 15 is 5,048-foot Newfound Gap, the road’s crest. The Appalachian Trail intersects the road here, and many people like to walk a bit of this historic route that runs some 2,180 miles from Georgia to Maine. The 4-mile, moderately strenuous hike to Charlies Bunion (a rocky knob with fine vistas) follows the Appalachian Trail and the Tennessee–North Carolina state line. Nearby is the 8-mile road to famed Clingmans Dome, usually closed from December through March. With an observation tower reached by a 0.5-mile paved trail, the site offers a grand panorama of the Appalachians on clear days. The “view” is just gray clouds when fog shrouds the peaks at this 6,643-foot elevation, the highest in the Smokies. Stop at Mingus Mill (Mile 30) to see a restored 1886 grist mill that uses a turbine rather than a waterwheel to turn the millstones—advanced technology for its day. A miller is on site to explain the operation. The easy, 1.5-mile Oconaluftee River Trail features displays highlighting Native American history.

        <h3 class="navy">Cades Cove</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Located in the western part of the Tennessee side of the park, this broad, 2,400-acre valley was home to more than 130 families in the mid-19th century. Many of their homes, barns, churches, and other buildings still dot the landscape, adding to the appeal of this portion of the park. What once were farm fields (largely corn) are now open grasslands, a boon for wildlife watchers. So popular is Cades Cove that in summer and the “leaf-peeping” foliage season of October, it can take hours to drive the 11-mile one-way loop road. Among Cades Cove highlights is the 1820s John Oliver Place, the oldest log house in the area, built of hand-hewn logs and split-wood shingles. About a mile farther along is the turn to the Primitive Baptist Church, built in 1887 to replace an earlier log cabin. About halfway around the loop is the short trail to the Elijah Oliver Place, a homestead that includes a log house, smokehouse, corn crib, spring house, and chicken coop. Note the “stranger room” added to the porch to accommodate visitors. A 2.5-mile trail leads to striking Abrams Falls—certainly not the tallest waterfall in the park but the largest by water volume.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy"></h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Cable Mill area is a must stop, encompassing a small visitor center, an operating water-powered grist mill, a striking “cantilever” barn (with a large roof overhang), a sorghum mill, an 1887 frame house, as well as several other buildings. The last portion of the loop passes several historic structures, including the Carter Shields Cabin, one of the most captivating photo opportunities in the park, especially in spring when the dogwoods are in full bloom. 
            
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy"></h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Elsewhere in the Park The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail, a 6-mile loop reached from downtown Gatlinburg (turn south at traffic light 8), provides a wonderful way for people with limited mobility to experience a Great Smokies forest. You’ll pass rocky streams and several log cabins and other historic structures, as well as the trailhead for the 1.3-mile walk to Grotto Falls, a waterfall that provides considerable scenic reward for moderate effort. A few miles east of Gatlinburg, off US 321, a side road follows the Little Pigeon River to the Greenbrier area. Here you’ll find the trailhead for the strenuous 4-mile hike to Ramsey Cascades, at 100 feet high the tallest waterfall in the park. The last two miles of this trail pass through splendid old-growth forest. A less strenuous option is the nearby 3.6-mile Porters Creek Trail, which heads upstream to an old cemetery, an 1875 barn, and a healthy grove of tall hemlocks. Spring wildflowers are a special seasonal attraction on Porters Creek Trail.

        <h3 class="navy"></h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Reached by winding mountain roads off either US 276 in North Carolina or Tenn. 32, the Cataloochee area was once home to the largest community in what is now the national park. Families totaling around 1,200 people farmed and raised livestock, and even developed an early tourism industry based on trout fishing. Today the Big and Little Cata-loochee valleys preserve several historic structures, including houses, barns, churches, and a schoolhouse. Cataloochee increased in popularity after 2001, when elk were reintroduced. It remains an excellent place to spot these animals as well as black bear and deer.
