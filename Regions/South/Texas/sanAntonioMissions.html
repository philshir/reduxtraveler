            Settlement in the San Antonio area dates from the early eighteenth century when explorers crossed the Rio Grande and began travelling though the lands north of Mexico, with the aim of extending the new Spanish territories. Besides the acquisition of new land, these pioneers also sought to spread the Catholic faith - new villages were based around a large church with other buildings for storage and living quarters, which together with cultivated areas for crops and animals were enclosed in a high protective wall, to ward off attacks from unfriendly groups of roving Apache and Comanche Indians.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The whole compound was termed a mission, and several dozen were built across south Texas, always near a river; as well as the San Antonio, they were constructed along the Rio Grande and Nueces, and further east along the Neches and Angelina. After the new territory was secured, the missions became important links in the supply route to lands in the east that were being threatened by French insurgents from Louisiana.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">The Missions</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            In 1718 Mission San Antonio de Valero was established along the San Antonio River; it was renamed The Alamo at the start of the next century and received enduring fame in 1836 at the culmination of a period of fierce Mexican attacks during the Texan War of Independence, when around 180 defenders, made up of settlers and native Texans, held out for 13 days against up to 5,000 enemy soldiers before finally being defeated. A second mission, San José, was founded nearby in 1720, and three unsuccessful communities from the Neches River in the east were transferred 10 years later. A fort, a village and an irrigation system with dam and aqueduct were added soon after, and the communities flourished, gradually becoming augmented by other development and forming the city of San Antonio.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Surroundings</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The five San Antonio missions survive intact and the southernmost four are protected as a National Historical Park, which incorporates various sites and tracts of land along the river connected by the Mission Trail, a 12 mile route along city streets that when complete will link The Alamo in the centre with Mission Espada, southernmost of the 5 churches. Outside the downtown area, the San Antonio River occasionally floods but usually has low water levels and is not particularly attractive. It is surrounded by a half mile ribbon of grass and woodland at either side; beyond, the suburbs of the city have extended most of the way south although not close enough to disturb the tranquil atmosphere of the missions, four of which are still used for regular church services.

        <h3 class="navy">The Alamo (Mission San Antonio de Valero)</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Most of the original grounds and buildings of The Alamo have long since disappeared beneath the San Antonio streets. The central church remains, plus various outbuildings now used as a museum, and a small pretty garden with cacti and other large plants. The Alamo is always very busy, with thousands of people visiting each day, and together with the nearby Paseo del Rio (The River Walk), is the most popular attraction in town.

        <p class="verd">
            Three miles south of the centre, the complex sits back from the road in a quiet, leafy residential area with an acre of lawn and gardens. The mission was one of the three moved in 1731 from unprofitable lands in east Texas. New buildings nearby do not detract from the attractively aged appearance of the central church, which is distinctly Spanish in design and has needed very little restoration over the years.

            This is the southernmost church, surrounded by woodland in a peaceful, rural setting although just 200 yards from the busy 410/281 ring road. This is the oldest mission in Texas, originally founded by the Neches River in 1690, then moved to its present location in 1731. Nearby is the Espada Aqueduct, in use since 1740 and protected as a National Historic Landmark.
