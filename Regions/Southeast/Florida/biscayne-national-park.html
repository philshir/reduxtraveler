        <p class="verd">
            Biscayne National Park preserves Biscayne Bay and its offshore barrier reefs. Ninety-five percent of the park is water, and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers 172,971 acres and includes Elliott Key, the park's largest island and northernmost of the true Florida Keys, formed from fossilized coral reef. The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the Florida Reef, one of the largest coral reefs in the world.

            Panama City Beach's sugar white sand is what primarily attracts families, couples and spring breakers year after year. But this vacation haven isn't just for beach bums. Outdoor adventurers will have plenty of land to explore at Conservation Park and the undeveloped Shell Island, while animal lovers can hop aboard dolphin sightseeing cruises or learn more about the area's various sea creatures at the Gulf World Marine Park. Those traveling with kids in tow will have plenty to do, too. When little ones aren't busy building sandcastles on the beach, they can marvel at the oddities at Ripley's Believe It or Not! or swoosh down water slides at Shipwreck Island Waterpark.
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            The park protects four distinct ecosystems: the shoreline mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.

        <p class="navy">Activities</p>
        <p class="verd">
            Biscayne National Park operates year-round. Camping is most practical in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours in the park that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita and Adams Key are also available. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park's visitor center on the mainland, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat.
        </p>

            <figcaption class="cap"></figcaption></figure>
        <p class="navy">Recreation</p>
        <p class="verd">
            Access to the park from the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. A private concessioner provides tours from the Park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April.

        <p class="navy">Island Facilities</p>
        <p class="verd">
            Most of Biscayne's permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. A seasonally staffed ranger station is on Elliott Key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. A single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the Spite Highway runs the length of the island. Adams Key is a day-use-only area for visitors. Boca Chita Key is the most-visited island, with a campground and picnic areas. The Boca Chita Lighthouse is occasionally open to visitors when staffing permits.

            Snorkeling and diving</p>
        <p class="verd">
            Snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. The reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. A selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the Maritime Heritage Trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the National Park Service system. The wrecks of the Arratoon Apcar (sank 1878), Erl King (1891), Alicia (1905), Lugano (1913) and Mandalay (1966) are on the trail together with an unknown wreck from the 1800s and the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse. The Alicia, Erl King and Lugano are relatively deep wrecks, best suited for scuba dives. The Mandalay is at a shallower depth and is especially popular for snorkeling.
Coral reef and offshore waters
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            Beyond the keys in the Atlantic Ocean the seafloor slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters.

            The Biscayne National Park Institute provides eco-adventures including snorkeling at a shipwreck on the Maritime Heritage Trail and colorful coral reefs full of life, cruises to Boca Chita Key and lighthouse, sailing on beautiful Biscayne Bay, exploring the seldom seen wonders of Jones Lagoon, and more.

            Canoeing and Kayaking</p>
        <p class="verd">
            Canoeing and kayaking are great ways to explore the mangrove fringed shorelines and shallow bay waters of the park. More experienced kayakers may enjoy crossing the seven mile expanse of Biscayne Bay to Elliott or Boca Chita Keys. Adams Key is a popular launching spot for those exploring these areas from the south. Using the islands as a base camp will allow exploration of the lagoons, creeks and channels south of Caesar Creek. Many of these places are too shallow for motorized vessels, so canoeists and kayakers are likely to have these places to themselves.

Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April. Launching your own paddlecraft is allowed from the designated area adjacent to the parking lot and is free of charge. Leaving a vehicle in the parking lot overnight is permitted when camping on one of the park islands, but please stop in the visitor center to fill out a free parking permit.

        <p class="verd">
            Shallow Jones Lagoon is a great place to see rays, upside-down jellyfish, schools of fish and wading birds. Be careful not to disturb the bird rookery (stay at least 300 feet away).
Hurricane Creek provides spectacular canoe and kayak opportunities. The creek was named for the fact that old-timers would tie their boats here during big storms. It offers excellent snorkeling beneath mangrove roots to observe sea squirts, crabs, anemones and other marine life.
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            Biscayne National Park's Maritime Heritage Trail offers an exciting opportunity to explore the remains of some of the park's many shipwrecks. Six wrecks, spanning nearly a century and a wide variety of sizes and vessel types, have been mapped, brochures have been produced and mooring buoys have been installed. The newest addition to the trail is the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse. Snorkeling is great around the base of the light, but the structure itself is not open to the public. Access to the sites on the trail is by boat only. Erl King, Alicia and Lugano are best suited to SCUBA divers, while the other sites can easily be enjoyed while snorkeling. Mandalay in particular offers an unparalleled opportunity for snorkelers to experience a shipwreck in a beautiful natural setting.
