            From Jackson, WY (4.9mi) Head north on US-191 N/US-26 E/US-89 N/N Cache St toward E Deloney Ave.

        <h3 class="navy">Overview</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Many other US mountains are taller, more extensive and equally rugged, but none can match the Teton Range in northwest Wyoming for the steepness with which the east face rises above the flatlands of the Snake River Valley, gaining over 5,000 feet in a horizontal distance of just a few miles, without any intervening foothills. Several dozen glaciers around the summits keep the mountains partly snow covered even in late summer, and for much of the year the peaks are buried beneath an unbroken expanse of ice. The mountains stretch for a relatively short distance, rising up near the small town of Jackson and extending northwards for 30 miles, until the land slopes down to the edge of the Pitchstone Plateau in Yellowstone National Park. The highest and most spectacular section of the Tetons is towards the south end, where several of the highest peaks (the Cathedral Group) are clustered together, centered on 13,770 foot Grand Teton. Twelve summits exceed 12,000 feet.

        <h3 class="navy">History</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Grand Teton National Park contains the eastern half of the mountains - the park boundary runs approximately along the crest - together with two other large features, 25,540 acre Jackson Lake and the wide valley of the Snake River, known as Jackson Hole. Along the edges of the valley are a dozen or so smaller lakes, which provide destinations for many of the park's trails. Only six paths climb into the mountains, most following a narrow, steep-sided canyon up into the high Alpine country above the treeline. All major summits are out of reach to regular hikers, however, instead accessible only to rock climbers. Besides hiking, climbing and general sight seeing, the park also offers boating (principally on Jackson and Jenny Lakes), fishing, skiing & snowboarding, camping, horse riding and wildlife viewing - Grand Teton National Park is home to all the varied wildlife found just to the north in Yellowstone, including bison and elk around the Snake River, moose in the stream-fed canyons, wolves anywhere in the lower elevations, grizzly bears across the northern section of the mountains, and black bears in the meadows and foothills. Both national parks may be visited for a single fee of $35 per vehicle (2019), valid for seven days.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Roads</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The main highway through the national park is US 191/89, which follows close to the east side of the Snake River, from Jackson north for 57 miles into Yellowstone National Park. Half way along it is joined by US 26/287 at Moran Junction, allowing access from the east. The only other route into the park is Moose-Wilson Road from the southwest, which leads to one of the lesser used trailheads (Granite Canyon). Although the best overall views of the mountains are from US 191/89, the principal scenic drive is Teton Park Road, running for 21 miles along the west edge of the valley, passing various lakes, trailheads, picnic areas and overlooks.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Seasons</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Moose-Wilson and Teton Park roads are closed in the winter, usually from the start of November to the beginning of May, though US 191/89 is open all year. NPS campgrounds and visitor centers have slightly shorter opening seasons, typically late May to early October. But many activities are still possible in the winter, from multi day cross-country skiing trips to just photographing the snowy mountains from the highway. January and February daytime temperatures peak in the 20s Fahrenheit (-5°C), dropping to zero or below at night, but rise by around 10 degrees each month until a maximum of the low 80s (ca. 28°C) is reached during July. Snow is likely in the valley any time between October and the start of May.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">US 191/89</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The main highway through Grand Teton National Park, from Jackson Hole north through Moose Junction, Antelope Flats, Moran Junction and Jackson Lake Junction, then on towards Yellowstone. Passes several trailheads, for hikes around Jackson Lake, Two Ocean Lake and Emma Matilda Lake
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img three" src="../../../resources/images/wyoming/grand-teton-one/grand-teton-hill-1000.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Seasons</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The gateway to Grand Teton National Park is the small but busy resort town of Jackson, which provides all necessary facilities, found mostly south of the historic but rather cramped center, where the roads are narrow and lined with many cafes, bars and Western gift shops. US 191/89 exits the north edge of town and is soon crossing empty countryside, bordered by a small mesa on the left side (Gros Ventre Butte), and an unbroken swathe of tall yellow grass on the other. This marshy land is part of the National Elk Refuge.
            The Tetons are not properly visible from Jackson or the first few miles of US 191, but come fully into view once past the national park boundary, where the highway rounds the edge of the hills and crosses the Gros Ventre River.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Moose Junction and Antelope Flats</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The main road passes Jackson Hole Airport - not surprisingly this is the only commercial airport in any US national park - and arrives at Moose Junction, at the south end of Teton Park Road, the most scenic route in the park. The Grand Teton National Park headquarters and the Craig Thomas Discovery Center are located near the intersection, beside the Snake River, and also one of the NPS entrance booths; there are none along US 191 as this is a major cross-state route so can be driven without payment. The next junction is with the Antelope Flats Road, a lesser-used route across treeless sagebrush flats, where bison, elk, pronghorn antelope and mule deer are often seen. The road reaches a T junction near the edge of the park, with both forks leading to free camping places in the neighboring Bridger-Teton National Forest - most popular is the left road, which after 2 miles passes several sheltered places at the edge of woodland. The sites have uninterrupted views across Jackson Hole towards the mountains, a view especially pretty at sunrise on a cloudless morning.
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img portrait" src="../../../resources/images/wyoming/grand-teton-one/grand-teton-lake-750wPortrait.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Moran Junction</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The highway continues north across similar sagebrush landscape for 15 miles, running quite close to the Snake River past one short trail (to Cunningham Cabin, an 1890s homestead) and various pull-outs for viewing the Tetons to the west, though there is not much else of interest until Moran Junction, where US 26/287 forks east, towards Dubois and Lander. US 191 turns northeast, through a national park entrance station and meets another junction, with Pacific Creek Road - leading amongst other places to a picturesque picnic area/trailhead at the edge of Two Ocean Lake. Not far beyond the junction, at Oxbow Bend the highway overlooks a slowly moving, semi-abandoned meander of the Snake River, curving through a flat marshy area. The pullout is a good place to look for wildlife such as beaver, muskrat, elk and moose, though there are no paths into this area.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Jackson Lake</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            At Jackson Lake Junction, US 191 meets the north end of Teton Park Road, shortly followed by Willow Flats Overlook, an elevated viewpoint of a big expanse of tall grass, reeds, marsh and sagebrush close to the edge of Jackson Lake. Two trails start at nearby Jackson Lake Lodge - one crosses the flats towards Colter Bay and the other leads eastwards to two lakes, one quite small (Christian Pond), the other much larger (Emma Matilda). The lodge sits just off the road on a low, wooded hill, offering various services including accommodation, a gas station, restaurant, and horse rentals.
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img three" src="../../../resources/images/wyoming/grand-teton-one/grand-teton-mountains-1000.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="cap">Overlook of South Side of Bend</figcaption></figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Colter Bay</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The last major site along the highway is Colter Bay Village, on wooded land right by the shore of Jackson Lake, at the end of a side road. Besides several easy trails to ponds, meadows and promontories by the shoreline, the village is also home to most of the park's facilities - it has a 350 site campground, a restaurant, lodge, boat launch, marina, visitor center, gas station and Indian arts museum. Half a mile or so of the shore may be reached by road, allowing easy access to lengthy sections of clean, stony beaches, with views of the lake, its islands, and the Tetons directly opposite.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Flagg Ranch</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            After another boat launch site (Leeks Marina), US 191/89 comes closer to Jackson Lake and runs right along the edge for a while, past three picnic areas before moving back into the forest, leaving the national park and entering a separate NPS preserve designated John D Rockefeller Jr Memorial Parkway, which contains just one visitor location at Flagg Ranch (campsite, lodge, general store and NPS information station), and a side track to Grassy Lake Reservoir. This leads, after a few miles through the trees, to over a dozen free campsites, equipped with rest room, tables & bbq grills, and some overlooking the Snake River - convenient places to stay when visiting both Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone, a few miles north. The parkway commemorates philanthropist and conservationist John Rockefeller, who helped in the early stages of the development of several national parks, including Grand Teton.
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            Steep mountainsides, Jackson Lake and the marshy Snake River valley provide obstructions that restrict hiking in Grand Teton National Park, so there are fewer trails than might be expected for an area this size. In particular, most of the northern half of the Teton Range, the section west of the lake, is inaccessible to all except determined cross-country hikers. Most of the day hikes are to smaller lakes, either close to park roads at the edge of the Snake River valley, or along the steep-sided canyons that cut into the mountains.
