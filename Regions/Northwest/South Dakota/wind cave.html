        <p class="verd">
            Wind Cave National Park is the first cave to be designated a national park anywhere in the world. The cave is notable for its calcite formations known as boxwork, as well as its frostwork. Approximately 95 percent of the world's discovered boxwork formations are found in Wind Cave. The cave is recognized as the densest cave system in the world, with the greatest passage volume per cubic mile. Wind Cave is one of the longest caves in the world with 149.01 miles of explored cave passageways, as of 2018. Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed-grass prairie in the United States.

        <h3 class="navy">Origin of Name</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The passages in the park are said to "breathe" as air continually moves into or out of them, equalizing the atmospheric pressure of the cave and the outside air. When the air pressure is higher outside the cave than inside it, air flows into the cave, raising the cave's pressure to match the outside pressure. When the air pressure inside the cave is higher than outside it, air flows out of the cave, lowering the air pressure within the cave. A large cave such as Wind Cave with only a few small openings will "breathe" more obviously than a small cave with many large openings. If a fast-moving storm was approaching on the day the Bingham brothers found the cave, the atmospheric pressure would have been dropping fast, causing the cave's higher-pressure air to rush out all available openings, creating the wind for which Wind Cave was named.
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            You can experience the park in one or two days. Wind Cave’s visitor center is located off US 385, in the southern part of the park and houses exhibits on cave geology, wildlife, and park history. Visitors may enter Wind Cave only on one of the many ranger-guided tours. All tours leave from the visitor center. If you have time for a second cave tour, take the Natural Entrance Tour, the Fairgrounds Tour, or the Garden of Eden Tour (shortest and easiest). For the best chance to see bison, drive Park Roads 5 and 6. Prairie dogs are usually easy to see along US 385 and S. Dak. 87. The Rankin Ridge Nature Trail offers fine views of the surrounding landscape, while the Wind Cave Canyon Trail offers an easy stroll into the park’s interior.

            On the Surface Quite often, bison (there are some 400 in the park) can be seen along US 385, which runs north-south through the park. Close to extinction in the 19th century, the result of hunting, bison were reintroduced shortly after the park’s establishment. Bison, pronghorn, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are commonly seen; elk are harder to spot. Best chances for a sighting: dawn and dusk at the edge of the ponderosa pine and aspen woodlands that are scattered among the grasslands. On a smaller note, prairie-dog towns, with their distinctive burrows, can be seen along park roads. Two unpaved roads, numbered 5 and 6, run for several miles through the eastern part of the park and make excellent wildlife drives. Here you may be lucky and spot a coyote, badger, or porcupine, along with birds such as western meadowlark, spotted towhee, black-billed magpie, burrowing owl, and golden eagle.
        </p>
        <p class="verd">
            Wind Cave includes about 30 miles of hiking trails, offering the chance to see its prairies and forests closely. A favorite is the moderately strenuous Rankin Ridge Nature Trail, a 1-mile loop that leads up to a fire tower at the park’s highest point. The views are wide-ranging here; at times you can see all the way to Badlands National Park, some 40 miles to the east. The less strenuous Elk Mountain Nature Trail, also about a mile, interprets the ecological zone where ponderosa pine forest meets the prairie. An excellent longer hike combines portions of the Centennial, Highland Creek, and Lookout Point Trails for a 4.5-mile loop. The trailhead is on S. Dak. 87, about a half-mile north of US 385, and the trek passes through a variety of habitats. An easier hike, Wind Cave Canyon (1.8 miles), follows a road past low bluffs with scattered trees and shrubs; it’s a fine walk for bird-watching.
