        <h3 class="navy">The Park</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            This part-park, part-museum, part-concert hall swallows central Manhattan, and many of the city's most notable attractions are situated next to it or within its limits (the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, to name a few). But travelers insist that you shouldn't just pass through Central Park on your way to another place. This 843-acre green space is a favorite of New Yorkers and tourists; you can come here to exercise, dine, go to the zoo and more.
            There's an almost impossible amount of sights to see here (hidden treasures, indeed), including 20 playgrounds, 48 fountains, monuments or sculptures and 36 bridges. Here's a shortlist:
      
        <figure><img class="deco-img" src="../../../resources/images/nyc/CentralPark/central-park-alice-in-wonderland-statue-1000.jpg" alt="Central Park Alice in Wonderland"/>
           </figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Alice in Wonderland</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Bronze sculptural groups set in small terraces front the Conservatory Water. One to the north, parallel with East 74th Street, commemorates Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, with an 11 feet tall Alice (whose face is modeled on that of the sculptor's daughter) sitting on a large mushroom at a tea party held by the Mad Hatter with the March Hare, the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, and Alice's kitten Dinah in her lap. It is favored by children who enjoy climbing on it. At the base of the statue, among other inscriptions, is a line from Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem "Jabberwocky".
        </p>
        <figure><img class="deco-img" src="../../../resources/images/nyc/CentralPark/central-park-bethesda-fountain-1000.jpg" alt="Central Park Bethesda Fountain"/>
           </figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Bethesda Fountain</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Bethesda Fountain is the central feature on the lower level of the terrace,
            The pool is centered by a fountain sculpture designed by Emma Stebbins in 1868 and unveiled in 1873. Stebbins was the first woman to receive a public commission for a major work of art in New York City. The bronze, eight-foot statue depicts a female winged angel touching down upon the top of the fountain, where water spouts and cascades into an upper basin and into the surrounding pool. Beneath her are four four-foot cherubs representing Temperance, Purity, Health, and Peace. Also called the Angel of the Waters, the statue refers to Healing the paralytic at Bethesda, a story from the Gospel of John about an angel blessing the Pool of Bethesda, giving it healing powers. In Central Park the referent is the Croton Aqueduct opened in 1842, providing the city for the first time with a dependable supply of pure water: thus the angel carries a lily in one hand, representing purity, and with the other hand she blesses the water below.

        <h3 class="navy">Conservatory Garden</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Conservatory Water is a pond located in a natural hollow within Central Park in Manhattan, New York City. It is located west of Fifth Avenue, centered opposite East 74th Street. The pond is surrounded by several landscaped hills, including Pilgrim Hill dotted by groves of Yoshino cherry trees and Pug Hill, resulting in a somewhat manicured park landscape, 
Conservatory Water is named for a glass-house for tropical plants and was intended to be entered from Fifth Avenue by a grand stair. The shore of Conservatory Water contains the Kerbs Memorial Boathouse, where patrons can rent and navigate radio-controlled model boats, as well as bronze sculptures.

        <h3 class="navy">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            New Yorkers love to jog by this beautiful 106-acre body of water located mid-park. It's especially scenic in autumn, when the surrounding trees are ablaze with seasonal colors.

           </figure>
        <h3 class="navy">Sheep Meadow</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Sheep Meadow is a 15-acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park, between West 66th and 69th Streets in Manhattan, New York City. It is adjacent to Central Park Mall to the east, The Ramble and Lake to the north, West Drive to the west, and Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the south.
Sheep Meadow has a long history as a gathering place for large-scale demonstrations and political movements. These have included festivals, rallies, concerts, and protests.
Sheep Meadow opens at 11 a.m. each day between April and October each year. The meadow is closed during winters to allow the sod to grow back.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Loeb Boathouse</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            During the warm weather months you can rent a boat, bike or gondola from this Victorian-style boathouse and restaurant, located around East Park Drive next to the Bethesda Fountain.
        </p>
        <h3 class="navy">Strawberry Fields</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Named after John Lennon's song, this lower west park area (at West Park Drive and West 72nd Street) sits across the street from where the singer was assassinated in 1980. Visitors like to come here to eat lunch, admire the landscaping, or pay tribute to the Beatle.

        <h3 class="navy">The Mall</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Central Park Mall is a pedestrian esplanade in Central Park. It was designed so that a carriage could disgorge its passengers at the south end, then drive round and pick them up again overlooking Bethesda Terrace, whose view of the Lake and Ramble formed the "ultimatum of interest". To the east of the Mall, the wisteria pergola parallels the Mall at the top of a slope; it provides screening and separation from the Mall for another outdoor concert stage in New York's Central Park, Central Park SummerStage.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="topic">Naumburg Bandshell in 2019</span><br>
Facing onto the Mall near its upper end is the neo-classical half-domed Naumburg Bandshell The Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, founded in 1905 and the world's oldest, continuous free outdoor classical music concert series take place there as a gift to the public, each summer.
The bandshell has deteriorated over the years and was considered for demolition in 1989. Despite being preserved, it has never been fully restored.<br>
<br>
<span class="topic">Rumsey Playfield</span><br>
Rumsey Playfield, a small venue and bandshell for concerts, is located just east of the Mall. Located southwest of the intersection of Terrace and East Drives. Rumsey Playfield is also known as "the SummerStage" for the series of free corporate-sponsored concerts of the same name involving local and national talent that take place there every summer, and is also the site of the televised Friday morning summer concert series for the ABC morning program Good Morning America.

        <p class="verd">
            This Lower East Side spot is particularly popular with young families. In winter it's an ice skating rink; come summer, it's where you'll find the Victorian Gardens Amusement Park.

        <p class="verd">
            It contains exhibit rooms and an observation deck. An architectural hybrid of Gothic and Romanesque styles, Its name comes from belvedere, which means "beautiful view" in Italian.

        <h3 class="navy">Great Lawn Oval</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Great Lawn and Turtle Pond are two connected features of Central Park.
The pond abuts Belvedere Castle as well as the Delacorte Theater, and contains a variety of turtles and fish. The lawn is composed of 14 acres of oval-shaped land, which is used not only for sports but also for concerts.<br>
<br>
<span class="topic">Great Lawn</span><br>
The King Jagiello Monument stands at Turtle Pond's east end, the Delacorte Theater on its west end. The Great Lawn proper, surrounded by an oval-shaped path, covers 14 acres , while the Turtle Pond and the adjacent Arthur Rice Pinetum occupy another 31 acres. The Great Lawn and Turtle Pond take up about 55 acres in total.
The Great Lawn is mainly a recreational field, surrounded by an oval walkway. There are eight baseball fields on the Great Lawn (six within the oval walkway and two directly to the north), as well as a soccer field and four basketball courts.
<br>
<br>
<span class="topic">Pond</span><br>
The Turtle Pond is located south of the Lawn. Most of the park's turtles live in Turtle Pond, and many of these are former pets that were released into the park.<br>
Arthur Ross Pinetum<br>
The Arthur Ross Pinetum, named after philanthropist Arthur Ross, contains 17 species of pine trees across a 4-acre area on the northwestern side of the oval.

        <h3 class="navy">Bethesda Terrace</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Bethesda Terrace's two levels are united by two grand staircases and a lesser one that passes under Terrace Drive. They provide passage southward to the Central Park Mall and Naumburg Bandshell at the center of the park. The upper terrace flanks the 72nd Street Cross Drive and the lower terrace provides a podium for viewing the Lake. The mustard-olive colored carved stone is New Brunswick sandstone, with a harder stone for cappings, with granite steps and landings, and herringbone pattern paving of Roman brick laid on edge.

        <h3 class="navy">Cleopatra's Needle</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            Cleopatra's Needle, a red granite obelisk west of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the oldest man-made structure in Central Park. The needle in Central Park is one of three Cleopatra's Needles that were originally erected at the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis in Ancient Egypt around 1450 BC by the Pharaoh Thutmose III. The hieroglyphs were inscribed about 200 years later by Pharaoh Rameses II to glorify his military victories. The needles are so named because they were later moved to in front of the Caesarium in Alexandria, a temple originally built by Cleopatra VII of Egypt in honor of Mark Antony. The needle in Central Park arrived in late 1880 and was dedicated early the following year.

        <h3 class="navy">The Lake</h3>
        <p class="verd">
            The Ramble and Lake are two geographic features of Central Park in Manhattan, New York City. the features are located on the west side of the park between the 66th and 79th Street transverses. The 38-acre Ramble, located on the north shore of the Lake, is a forested area with highly varied topography and numerous winding walks, designated as a protected nature preserve. It was designed as a "wild garden" away from carriage drives and bridle paths, in which to be wandered, or to be viewed as a "natural" landscape. The Ramble includes several rustic bridges, and formerly contained a small cave. Historically, it has been frequented for both birdwatching and cruising.<br>
The serpentine 20-acre Lake offers dense naturalistic planting, rocky outcrops of glacially scarred Manhattan bedrock, small open glades, and an artificial stream (the Gill) that empties through the Azalea Pond, then down a cascade into the Lake. At the northwestern corner of the Lake, the ground rises toward Vista Rock, crowned by a lookout and folly named Belvedere Castle. The western shore includes the Ladies' Shelter, the southern shore contains a waterfront porch called Bethesda Terrace, and the eastern shore contains the Loeb Boathouse.

        <p class="verd">
            An outdoor granite sculpture of Alexander Hamilton by Carl Conrads. Hamilton's son, John C. Hamilton, commissioned Conrads to sculpt this statue, which was dedicated on November 22, 1880, and donated to the city. Hamilton lived nearby in Manhattan, at Hamilton Grange, when he died in 1804. Hamilton is dressed in Colonial style with a wig, ruffled collar, knickers, and buckle shoes. His right hand is on his chest, while his left hand is holding a rolled document, resting on a stone column. Thirteen stars encircle the top of the pedestal. A sword, scabbard and military hat are near the base of the pedestal.

        <p class="verd">
            A number of the sculptures are busts of authors and poets, located on Literary Walk adjacent to the Central Park Mall. Another cluster of sculptures, around the Zoo and Conservancy Water, are statues of characters from children's stories. A third sculpture grouping primarily depicts "subjects in nature" such as animals and hunters. Alice in Wonderland Margaret Delacorte Memorial (1959), a sculpture of Alice, is at Conservatory Water. Angel of the Waters (1873), by Emma Stebbins, is the centerpiece of Bethesda Fountain. Balto (1925), a statue of Balto, the sled dog who became famous during the 1925 serum run to Nome, is near East Drive and East 66th Street.[397] King Jagiello Monument (1939, installed 1945), a bronze monument, is at the east end of Turtle Pond. Women's Rights Pioneers Monument (2020), a monument of Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was the city's first statue to depict a female historical figure.
